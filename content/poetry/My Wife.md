> Some women hit the club with a new spray tan<br>
> My wife hits the curb with our old minivan<br>
> Some women workout like a fitness lady<br>
> My wife works her arms as she holds our baby<br>
> Some women start their day with a carmel cream brew<br>
> My wife fixes toys with gorilla glue<br>
> Some women can't resist their boyfriend's tease<br>
> My wife can't find where she put my keys<br>
> Some women purse lips with lipstick red<br>
> My wife's purse includes an old piece of bread<br>
> Some women pass out from intoxication<br>
> My wife passes out a church invitation<br>
> Some women have wealth and seek out pleasure<br>
> My wife herself is my greatest treasure
