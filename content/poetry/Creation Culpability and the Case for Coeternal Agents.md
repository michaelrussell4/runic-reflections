Is God to blame? It depends. If God created everything from scratch with complete foreknowledge and control, there are virtually no others to blame. God would be the author whose pen unmistakably wrote out each part and event.

> God creates with foreknowledge, predestining our fate → Our fate is determined by God, not us → God, not us, is to blame.

Why a benevolent being such as God would predestine anyone to eternal suffering is beyond me. Adherents to this philosophy claim he is sovereign and such is his prerogative. Say this if you like, but it does nothing to resolve the moral dilemma at stake. Perhaps it could be his right to exert this influence upon some, fating them to evil, but it is abhorrent to moral intuition. Some resist this dissonance, shifting their focus onto the enjoyment of their precious salvation. Gratefully, they were lucky enough to have been allotted such, they think.

Others view the fate of those unfortunate souls with discomfort, enough for them to suggest this fate is of necessity, but deprive God of power in doing so, making him beholden to hypothetical boundaries or laws. They might argue we are not in a position to evaluate God's justice. This raises the question why God would create us in such a way where his behavior is morally detestable to us. Another, more lethal, blow to this argument is what God says of Adam following his partaking of the forbidden fruit.

> Genesis 3:22
> 
> Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil

Can we not then judge between good and evil?

This leads to the crux of monergism, that it is morally indigestible. Not an antinomy, but a contradiction, lies at its core. The moral incongruence is simply incompatible. I'm afraid, the only escape is to reexamine God. Perhaps he is not benevolent afterall, disagreeable, yet logically compatible. Or perhaps he did not create from nothing.

There is another possibility—one that some may find heretical or at least deeply challenging. Suppose we allow for the existence of a coeternal substance or agent, distinct from God, which participates in the creation of souls. By doing so, we shift some measure of responsibility away from God and attribute it to these self-directing agents. Enabled by God but not controlled by him, these agents act independently, even as God’s influence remains pervasive.

Whether these are mysterious intelligences existing from eternity or, perhaps, literal emanations of God himself, we cannot say with certainty. Functioning as “random seeds” in the algorithm of souls, these agents break the chain of absolute determinism. In this way, they provide a conceptual bridge—an explanatory lemma—that allows for the compatibility of free will, moral justice, and the benevolent character traditionally ascribed to God.

Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hinted at this mysterious yet compelling doctrine:

> D&C 93:29
>
> Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.

Later, he expounded on this in a discourse that became known as the King Follett Sermon:

> I am dwelling on the immortality of the spirit of man. Is it logical to say that the intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it has a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal [co-eternal] with our Father in heaven.
> …
> The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits.

This doctrine radically challenges the traditional Christian notion that God is the only uncreated being and all else was created from nothing. However, it also offers a solution to the problems of this traditional view, such as the issue of God being the responsible originator of suffering, evil, damned souls, etc. Before rejecting this new teaching merely for its disagreement with some traditional views, it's worth evaluating the source of such. The bible never explicitly says God created everything from nothing. Even verses which may seem to indicate this, upon closer reading, don't actually say such a thing. E.g., "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made" (John 1:3); either this verse refers only to contingent, uncreated objects, or if we are to assume the all-encompassing interpretation, strictly, even God himself would be created by himself [ref](https://www.rightreason.org/2011/does-john-13-rule-out-uncreated-abstract-objects/). You can't have your cake and eat it, too. Either "all things" leaves out uncreated things, or it paradoxically encompasses even God himself.

Personally, I find it questionable when we treat scriptures like mathematical axioms of perfection that would not be modified by the authors with interrogation. Regardless, I claim that upon a close inspection of any worthy source for support, we find ourselves unsure whether this dogma of creation ex nihilo can hold as necessarily true. If there exists a compatible alternative
