> Old lady Latin oft rears her head<br>
> In our English, though long dead<br>
> Learn her well and you will see<br>
> How helpful this to you can be<br>
> <br>
> We'll start off firstly with **Aqua**<br>
> Picture the large and hairy Chewbacca<br>
> Drinking and bathing in the water<br>
> Swimming around in an **aqua**rium<br>
> With **aqua**tic animals round near him<br>
> He's from Star Wars not Harry Potter<br>
> Maybe you guessed it, our word means "water"<br>
> <br>
> Next let's visit loud aunt **Aud**<br>
> She likes to loudly speak a lot<br>
> She likes to listen to loud **aud**io<br>
> When we turn on the radio<br>
> She sings as if she's at an **aud**ition<br>
> With an **aud**ience listening to her rendition<br>
> Hoping for an endless cheer<br>
> And don't forget, this word means "hear"<br>
> <br>
> Moving on is our friend **Bene**<br>
> He's really good, even though he's skinny<br>
> His presence is a **bene**fit<br>
> He's really so **bene**volent<br>
> Do you know what **bene** means?<br>
> It means "good", now eat your greens!<br>
> <br>
> Now do you know the bad, bad name?<br>
> It's **Mal**, and this word means the same<br>
> **Mal**ice is not good, you see<br>
> It's **mal**evolent as bad can be<br>
> Remember this, and don't **mal**function<br>
> That would mean you badly function<br>
> <br>
> **Dict**, tack, toe, three in a row<br>
> Oops, it's "tick" not **dict** you know<br>
> I did not **dic**tate it well<br>
> I pre**dict** you will not tell<br>
> Can you say "**dict**ionary"?<br>
> Our word means "speak", it is not scary<br>
> <br>
> That's enough for now, I guess<br>
> There are so many but let's not stress<br>
> I hope you're happy as a hen<br>
> And come back reading this again
