> A supercilious zealot<br>
> Was passing through the land<br>
> She took an orange and peeled it<br>
> Then ate it from her hand<br>
> <br>
> With a frown upon her forehead<br>
> She surveyed the folks around<br>
> "Your diets are atrocious!"<br>
> "Your choices quite unsound!" <br>
> <br>
> She marched into the village<br>
> With charts and graphs in tow<br>
> "Your meals lack proper metrics"<br>
> "You simply do not know!"<br>
> <br>
> "No more of bread and butter"<br>
> "No sweets, no meat, no cheese"<br>
> "You'll thrive on quinoa salads"<br>
> "With herbal teas and peas!"<br>
> <br>
> The villagers looked puzzled<br>
> They'd thrived on what they ate<br>
> But she insisted loudly<br>
> "Your health is here at stake!"<br>
> <br>
> With every bite she banished<br>
> She claimed to know what's best<br>
> Yet as she preached her wisdom<br>
> Their meals did lose their zest<br>
> <br>
> The baker lost his business<br>
> The butcher threw up his hands<br>
> As the farmers all struggled<br>
> To grow the foreign plants<br>
> <br>
> "Your choices are all wrong!"<br>
> She cried, with fervent zeal<br>
> "Embrace my grand solutions"<br>
> "And you'll know how to feel!"<br>
> <br>
> But soon the fields lay barren<br>
> The laughter turned to sighs<br>
> For in her quest for virtue<br>
> She'd snuffed out all their highs<br>
> <br>
> At last, the villagers gathered<br>
> With a plan to take a stand<br>
> They tossed her charts and fables<br>
> And reclaimed their vibrant land<br>
> <br>
> "Dear zealot, we were thriving"<br>
> "Before you came to preach"<br>
> "Your measures brought us heartache"<br>
> "Your wisdom, out of reach."<br>
> <br>
> So off she went, defeated<br>
> With a highfalutin sneer<br>
> The zealot's final lesson:<br>
> Not all need her veneer.<br>
