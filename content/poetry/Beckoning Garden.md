> Implanted in the human heart<br>
> A yearning for our garden lost<br>
> We needn't anyone to teach<br>
> Provoking this desire<br>
> <br>
> Luscious greens<br>
> Pinks and yellows<br>
> Sweet perfumes<br>
> Breezes mellow<br>
> <br>
> I recall this dreamâ€”this pleasant womb<br>
> Admiring fields of flower in bloom<br>
> A remnant of that garden of yore<br>
> She awaits my return, she softly implores
