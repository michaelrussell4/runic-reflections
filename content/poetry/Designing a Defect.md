The caricature god, poorly formed yet widely believed, creates from absolute nothing with absolute power and knowledge. He creates a cloud and it does as intended, a rock and it sits where he pleases. Even the ants, the fish and fowl do only what he has designed. Omniscience is never astonished. Omnipotence is sure to succeed. Surprises and frustration are for the ignorant and weak, not this god—constitutionally absurd.

Yet still they argue that free will exists, to surprise and upset this being. Then, to hell, he'll see them burn; he who created and designed with deliberation and control, who sets their fate. When creating, did he lack power on their behalf; would their actions betray his programming? Some say though he knew what they would do, it was they who would choose willingly. But who made in them the stuff of their decisions: disposition, nature, and thoughts? God, alone did create the conditions for them and all things from which spring reaction. Their substance and essence, all sources of choice, were his to control. The causal ground of their fate must trace back to his powerful, all-knowing hands.

This false god is a misunderstanding. His ways: utter incoherence. Each has a mind to spot and to find, the holes in this man-made creation.

The truth will transcend these foolish conceptions. The sun will enlighten our minds from this night. Eternal mysteries and long-lost facts will soothe us from wretched mistaking. Something of souls is eternal, like God, and nothingness never existed.
