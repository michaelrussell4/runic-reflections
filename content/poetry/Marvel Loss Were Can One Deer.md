# Marvel Loss Were Can One Deer

> I learned in God's acre of the [accouchement](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accouchement) of a [neophyte](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neophyte) which wast yonder.<br>
[Iwis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Iwis) ifsoever he grew defiant then God's blessing he would squander.<br>
By the millennium they fell [wellaway](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wellaway)<br>
And [outward](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/outward) of God's alley.<br>

## Notes

This marvelous work and a wonder speaks of the Nephites (new converts) born in the promised land and given promise that if they kept God's commandments they would prosper in the land, otherwise He would case them off.
