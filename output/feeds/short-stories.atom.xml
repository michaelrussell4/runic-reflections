The boy thought of the gold and wealth and, being quite poor, gladly consented and asked where to look. The old man told him to start digging. When the boy asked where the man answered: "Right here is a good place to start." The boy obtained a shovel and began digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day the boy had dug a large hole deeper than his height. The old man looked inside and said, "You've found it!" The boy was confused as he stared at the empty hole. "Sir, what did I find? There's nothing in the hole." The old man replied, "Yes, that's right. Would you like me to pay you your portion now?" The boy was even more confused and replied, "Sir, how can you pay me when nothing has been found?" "I'll give you half of it, how about that?" the old man said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy's confusion now turned to anger, "You mean I've spent the whole day digging for nothing? And now I shall receive my reward of nothing? I've been foolish to help you." The old man reassured the boy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your work has not been in vain. You see, I spent my whole life searching for the most valuable treasures. In my small village our wealthiest man possessed a black stone of exquisite sharpness from which he made spearheads and knives. This prized, black stone was called obsidian and was the most precious stone I knew of. I searched and searched until I found some for myself and then I became the most wealthy man of my village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon I met a wealthy traveler who passed through our village. He had a robe made of the smoothest and finest fabric I had ever seen. He told me it was silk and was made with great skill and effort and was the most expensive fabric in all the world. I then left my village and sought to find where I could obtain this silk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traveled until I found someone who knew the trade of making silk. To my great astonishment, I learned that this expensive fabric was produced from a certain moth. You see, moths are like butterflies and begin as a small worm-like creature that eats from leaves until it is ready to build a cocoon. It wraps itself in this cocoon and hangs from a leaf until it becomes a moth. But a certain kind of these makes a cocoon of silk thread. I learned how one could take the cocoon before the moths breaks out of it and boil it in water, killing the moth and softening the silk. Then, slowly and carefully, the silk thread could be unwound and then used to weave into fabric. I learned this trade and made and sold silk and became quite wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I soon learned of something more valuable than silk—pearls. You see, pearls are made by shelled creatures that live deep underwater. Courageous divers swim deep to the floor of the ocean and bring up these shelled creatures and pry open their shells with knives. Most of the shelled creatures don't have pearls in them. Divers may open thousands of them before finding the one who has a pearl inside. I began learning this trade and began diving in search for the pearl. I dove and searched all day every day. I became a strong swimming and could hold my breath for a long time. My luck turned up soon because while many divers wouldn't find a single pearl their whole life, I found one after only three years of diving. I was then a very wealthy man indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my wealth led me to a society of others who were also very wealthy. I learned of many other treasures such as diamonds, rubies, silver, and gold. I traded and worked until I gained all these treasures. I spent many years after that chasing wealth and though I accumulated many treasures and became very wealthy, I was not content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once when I was telling my sorrows to a friend he told me that there was a being who lived at the top of the highest mountain nearby my home who was thought to have answers to every question. I thought he would certainly know the answer to my question so I journeyed up the mountain to ask him. When I arrived I found no such man, only a bird perched on a tree. I was greatly disappointed at this and shouted: 'Who can tell me what is more valuable than all my treasures?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to my great surprise, the bird replied, 'All my treasures' I marveled at this. I responded to the bird's question, 'What treasures do you have?' Instead of answering my question the bird asked me, 'What treasures do you have?' I then showed the bird all my treasures of gold, silver, rubies, and diamonds and said, 'Here are all of my treasures.' The bird responded, 'All my treasures.' 'No, these are mine,' I responded. 'No, these are mine,' he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was angry that this bird claimed that my treasures were his. But then I began to see the great wisdom in his words and I forsook my wealth. I buried it there at the top of the mountain and learned a great secret, 'Nothing is greater than all the treasures of the world.' I climbed that mountain burdened by the weight of my wealth, both in body and mind. I left that mountain feeling light and free in body and mind. Nothing truly was greater than all my wealth. And now I give you this gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy thought about what the man had said and asked, "Sir, this mountain where you buried your wealth, where is it?" The man replied, "Why, it's this mountain here" and he pointed to a tall mountain within sight. And the boy was enlightened and replied, "Thank you, sir." And he set off for that mountain leaving the old man in deep thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story uses irony as an attempt to criticize common notions of enlightenment which are often trivial and impractical. While there may be truth in the lesson learned by the old man, the boy practically seeks to obtain the wasted treasure of the man. Who was enlightened?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Short Stories"></category></entry><entry><title>The Heifer Haunting</title><link href="/2024/the-heifer-haunting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-30T14:42:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-09-30T14:42:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Mike Russell</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-09-30:/2024/the-heifer-haunting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There once was a man who lived with his wife and children in a small cottage in the woods.

The man was poor and had little to eat besides the milk, cheese, and butter produced from the cow. The man's wife and children complained for their hunger and the man went to punish the cow. He scolded her, saying, "You old cow! What good are you if you can't make us milk? We shall starve because of you." The man then realized he could kill the cow and feed his family with her meat. He told this idea to the cow to which she responded, "Don't kill me or I shall haunt you." The man responded, "You shan't frighten me any more as a ghost than you do while alive by causing us such great hunger. Therefore, I will butcher you and we shall be fed and well for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the man killed the cow and his family was well fed upon beef that night. They did not complain of the lack of milk, cheese, and butter. But as the man slept that night, he heard a fearful noise. It came from outside. He put on his trousers and boots and ventured outside. As he opened the door, he beheld a bovine apparition, and he recognized it instantly to be his old cow. She lowed, groaned, and moaned making terrible faces at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was quite bothered by the cow's behavior and shut the door on her. He attempted to go back to bed, but the lowing, groaning, and moaning made sleeping impossible. He opened the door again to meet the cow to see if diplomacy could solve his dilemma. "Cow, you must understand how hungry my family has been due to your milk supply drying up", he said. "We were left with few choices." To which the cow lowed the louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continued for a few nights and the man became so tired for lack of sleep that he couldn't stay awake during the day. His wife and children suffered in the same way, too. Then the man came up with an idea. He got some cotton and plugged his ears and those of his wife and children. That night they lay in their beds with plugged ears and couldn't hear the cow's haunting, lowing, and groaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They awoke in the morning having slept well for the first night in many. The cow noticed her attempt to annoy the man was thwarted. That night she flew up to the moon and bade the moon follow her down to the window of the man's house. The moon so did and lit the house entirely as if it were day. The man opened his eyes at the light wondering if it were morning already. "How can it be morning when I'm so tired? I couldn't have slept more than an hour", thought he. But when he looked out his window, he saw his old ghostly cow smugly standing by the moon which was blindingly bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several nights this went on and the man could not sleep well at all. But an idea came to his mind to solve his problem. He made some leather eye masks that he and his family could wear while sleeping. That night they tied the eye masks on and though the moon shown through their window and lit their room as bright as day, their eyes saw only darkness being covered by their leather eye masks. The cow saw again that her attempt to annoy the man was thwarted and she conjured up another plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the man lay down to rest that night a foul and putrid smell filled his house. He scrunched his nose wondering, "Whatever could that awful smell be?" His children and his wife complained at the smell saying that it made sleep impossible. The man put his boots and trousers on and went outside to find the old ghostly cow flatulating profusely in his direction. The cow lowed with a gloating and victorious tone and the man crossly slammed the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day the man's wife suggested they use clothes pins to plug their noses. That night they each did this and were able to sleep through the night for they could not smell the awful smell as their noses were plugged. The next day they awoke well rested and satisfied. The cow saw that again her attempt was foiled and thought for a long time how she could disturb the man again. She could not do so with noise for the man had plugged his ears. She could not do so with light for the man had covered his eyes. She could not do so with stink for the man had plugged his nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she crafted one last idea to punish the man. That night she stomped upon the ground so hard that it caused the earth to quake around his house. The man and his family lay in their beds bouncing up and down with each stomp. The quaking so disturbed the man that he could not sleep at all that night. This was a problem the man did not know how to solve. He thought all the next day how to remedy the problem, but nothing came to mind. The next night the cow again began to march around the house stomping so hard that the whole house quaked. The family didn't get a wink of sleep. The next day the man's two children were playing outside despite being very tired from lack of sleep. The older of the two was a boy of seven years and the younger a girl of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brother pretended to be a wolf and chased the girl as she ran laughing. Then she said to her brother who was still pretending to be a wolf, "You wolf, you should chase our old cow away whose ghost won't let us sleep." The brother said, "Why yes, what a wonderful idea!" And together they colluded how to chase the old cow away that night. The girl with the help of her mother sewed a wolf costume for her brother. The brother found the carcass of a wolf and took the head home for his mother to work into the costume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night the boy snuck out and hid in the trees until it was dark. The rest of the family lay in their beds. The father said provoking their ruse, "I sure hope the old cow doesn't come tonight for I am very weary and tired." The cow heard this and snickered, then appeared saying, "You won't be sleeping tonight. For I shall haunt you thoroughly until morning light." Then the cow began her stomping and lowing and farting and puffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then, the boy who had been hiding in the trees dressed in his wolf costume came out barking and growling at the cow. The cow was terribly frightened at the sight of the wolf and began to float away. But because the boy was wearing as part of his costume the head of a dead wolf, the spirit of that lupine carcass floated along with him and when seeing the ghost of the cow, the wolf's ghost chased after until he caught up with the cow and gobbled her up in one bite. The ghost of the wolf was then satisfied and it howled at the moon and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the end of their troubles with the cow. The man and his family were again able to sleep peacefully each night. He and his family then began a trade selling ear plugs, eye masks, and nose plugs to those who were troubled at night by loud, bright, or smelly roomates. He became quite wealthy from this trade and lived happily and well with his family from there on after.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Short Stories"></category></entry></feed>
