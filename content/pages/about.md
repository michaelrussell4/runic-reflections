Summary: Learn more about the purpose and inspiration behind Runic Relics, a collection of poetry exploring spiritual, philosophical, and linguistic creativity.

Welcome to **Runic Relics**, a digital collection of poetry where words become tools to explore the depths of thought, spirit, and imagination. My name is **Mike**, and this site serves as a home for my poetic expressions, a way to capture and share moments of insight, wonder, and learning.

Here, you'll find poems spanning a variety of themes:

- **Religious and spiritual reflections** that touch on the eternal and divine.  
- **Philosophical musings** that question, ponder, and seek meaning.  
- **Comedic verses** for lighthearted fun and a laugh along the way.  
- **Children’s poetry** to delight young minds and their grown-up companions.  
- **Vocabulary-building experiments**—a playful approach to expanding linguistic horizons.

While some of my poems, like *A Delphic Prophecy*, wrestle with cryptic and profound themes, others, like *An Alliance to Abdicate*, are opportunities for me to challenge myself with language and explore the beauty of words. The intention is never to impress, but to learn and share joy in the craft of writing.

### How the Site Works

**Runic Relics** is built using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator that converts simple Markdown files into a polished website. Every poem I write begins as a Markdown file, allowing me to focus on the words themselves. A simple `git push` brings new creations to life on the site.

Thank you for visiting Runic Relics. I hope these poems inspire thought, spark curiosity, or simply bring a smile. Feel free to explore, reflect, and enjoy this evolving collection of verses.
