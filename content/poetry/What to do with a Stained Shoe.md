> Fleck, blot, stain, spot<br>
> Oops I spilled a lot<br>
> What can I do for my new blue shoe?<br>
> I need to do it before I chew<br>
> For when I chew I spill my food<br>
> And when I spill I stain my shoe<br>
> What can I do with a stained shoe?<br>
> Maybe I'll give it to a monkey in a zoo<br>
> But I doubt he'll say "thank you"<br>
> So instead I'll give it to you
