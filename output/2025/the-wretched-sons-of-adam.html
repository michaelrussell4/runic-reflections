      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>A wild man born into tribulation
Works his life to improve his station
He feeds his needs with strength of hand
Hunting beasts with a chosen band</p>
<p>His son improves a shelter secure
His gains are found with rope and lure
A family protected, a future perceived
Tomorrow exists; thought is acheived</p>
<p>Wealth is gained by domestication
Growth ensues on a furtile foundation
Children are reared and carefully taught
Money's invented and merchandise bought</p>
<p>"Perhaps", thinks man exercising his brain
"We could elude hunger, toils, and pain"
This thought led to action
And soon it gained traction</p>
<p>Year after year inventions were made
Wells issued water with bucket and braid
Beasts of burden plowed the field
Smiths forged tools for man to wield</p>
<p>But an odd thing happened with each improvement
These tools for man did not still his movement
He hadn't more rest nor absense of worry
Always in a hurry his thoughts in a scurry</p>
<p>Even more to add to this
His learning threatened to steal his bliss
For as man slowly tamed his brawn
His mind would reason from dusk to dawn</p>
<p>"Why do we work‚Äîwhy do we play?"
"All is vanity at the end of day."
"What I took as a child magic to be"
"Seems more so now like machinery."</p>
<p>As man's burdens were lightened
All the more his mind frightened
His soul wore new manacle
His heart grew mechanical</p>
<p>With softened skin and hardened soul
Dead eyes that none could console
He'd watch with pain
The children playing</p>
<p>"Oh how they frolic" said he
"Those young, poor fools cannot see"
"If they only knew how empty life was"
"Then they might give their play pause"</p>
<p>He snidely snarked in smug misery
As the children laughed and played with glee
That day the man died a poor genius
As the children explored rocks on venus</p>
<p>The children grew up and matured
But their reality was blurred
Figments of their former fantasy
Revived with life to threaten their sanity</p>
<p>Against better knowledge they saw
Supernatural sightings forced rueful awe
Doubt vied reason wreaking terrible treason
What uncertain times came with this new season</p>
<p>War and sickness truth and lie
Questions were asked wondering why
Wrestling souls fraught with dissonance
Angst of curiousity makes a mighty impetus</p>
<p>Poor creatures changed their outside
But a poison festered inside
Though work and toil were almost gone
Their misery lived on and on</p>
<p>Such is the state of those who are dead
No solace no answers only dread
It's not the body nor mind of course
But a heart disconnected from its life Source</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This poem chronicles man's efforts to save himself from his own misery. He thinks that removing his burdens and pains will soothe his psyche but, alas, his God-hunger lives on. He cannot be complete without his Connection and Life. See hints to different ages of man: stone, byzantine, industrial, etc.</p>
