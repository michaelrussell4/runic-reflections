# A Song of Praise

> God Thou art good forever<br>
Thy mercy streams like a river<br>
Thy glory shines as rays of light<br>
Giving life and warmth to creation<br>
Thou hearest my prayers great or small<br>
I'm left with no doubt that thine eye sees all<br>
Sweet assurance to know I am known<br>
With Thy love and grace am I overcome<br>
Confidence abides in me faithful from Thee<br>
Reign over all for eternity<br>
Blessed God praise to Thy name<br>
I praise Thee I honor Thee I worship Thee
