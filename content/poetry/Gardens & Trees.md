> First in Eden now Gethsemane<br>
> They both partook and could not flee<br>
> The tree of knowledge, the tree of death<br>
> To quicken or to end their breath<br>
> First one fell and the latter rose<br>
> Both had suffered evil's throes<br>
> Judged by God and then by men<br>
> "Where art thou, God," uttered again<br>
> From garden to garden, fallen to raised<br>
> Trees accompany their grace<br>
> Rivers flow first clear then stained<br>
> A branch of power to free the chained<br>
> A flood's reflection was their mirror<br>
