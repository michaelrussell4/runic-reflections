> When what one sought<br>
Has come to naught<br>
Or life is fraught<br>
With what ought not<br>
<br>
One cries their eyes<br>
Or laughs with sighs<br>
Why on this wise<br>
Do such arise?<br>
<br>
Ironic fate<br>
Brings joy or hate<br>
As curses great<br>
Or jokes relate<br>
<br>
Perhaps a tear<br>
From pain or cheer<br>
The same compares<br>
Throughout the years<br>
<br>
A wretched laugh<br>
A humorous cry<br>
