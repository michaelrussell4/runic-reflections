> Naked come I into the world<br>
But as I grow I fear<br><br>
I grasp at leaves to hide myself<br>
Illusory cover I wear<br>
From leaf to cloth my armor grows<br>
A soothing assurance dear<br><br>
Threats still lurk and bind my heart<br>
So I craft a scepter and spear<br>
I turn to predator from prey<br>
My dominion and power are clear<br><br>
All things to me subjected<br>
Just then my facade shows a tear<br>
The curtain unveils a helpless child<br>
Stripped and totally bare<br><br>
Death laughs at my attempts<br>
As he inches very near<br>
My fallen fortress fades<br>
I sink behind his leer<br><br>
Vanity it was to hide<br>
To avarice my care<br>
With greedy eyes I lusted then<br>
With empty eyes now I stare<br><br>
Naked go I out again<br>
I accept and submit without fear
