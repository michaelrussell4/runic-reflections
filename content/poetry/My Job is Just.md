Title: My Job Is Just

Job was just, his complaint valid
God on trial for glory pallid
He claimed he'd been wronged
Abject suffering prolonged
Absconding friends and scoffing foes
Job's mettle destroyed and his hope froze
Where was the God of fathers before
Who promised to answer the knock of door?
Did Job not knock and ask to receive?
A sound mind says he'd been deceived
Promises given were tested to fail
And Job was left to mourn and wail
How is this just or fair or good?
God and we look on who misunderstood?
