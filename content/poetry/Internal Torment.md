> Can vinegar bitter bite my tongue<br>
> Purge my heart from dirt and dung<br>
> Prefer its taste to salt or sweet<br>
> Mind sits still ill desire delete<br><br>
> Surge of fear that I might falter<br>
> Give me a coal from off the altar<br>
> I do as I want which thing I hate<br>
> Can I will my want or is it fate?

## Notes

This poem is about the inner struggle with unwanted desires. References made to the sponge with vinegar offered to Christ, a coal from the altar for Isaiah, and a quote from Arthur Schopenhauer about willing our wants.

Internal instead of eternal torment, though they may be much the same.

8 lines. 33 characters per line. These remind of Christ.
