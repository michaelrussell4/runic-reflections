# Waves of Song

> Rhythm like waves has power to lift<br>
Pitches like words penetrate swift<br>
A peculiar language my heart understands<br>
Vibrations created by wind and hands<br>
Emotion, passion, power profound<br>
How do I cry and laugh at this sound<br>
It moves my soul and evades comprehension<br>
Soothing relaxation or volatile tension<br>
With it flows my breath and mind<br>
In it respite I find
