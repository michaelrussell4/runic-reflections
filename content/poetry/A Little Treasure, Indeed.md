> Debauchery is reason, they say<br>
> To live and breathe from day to day<br>
> Libertinismâ€”the way of freedom<br>
> Taken to be a garden of Eden<br>
> Yet, ironic as it may seem<br>
> Quick as a fire burns this scheme<br>
> <br>
> Alas, ecstasy pines away<br>
> Fugacious pleasures do not stay<br>
> <br>
> Quickly given, quickly spent<br>
> Sharp ascension, sharp descent<br>
> <br>
> A fire burned; now it's out<br>
> A blackened hole, a brutal drought<br>
> <br>
> For your life to start again<br>
> Plant your seeds and wait for rain<br>
> Patience, virtue: friends, be thine<br>
> Waste not more your precious time<br>

# Notes

Depeche Mode [said it](https://dmlive.wiki/wiki/Pleasure,_Little_Treasure),

> Everybody's looking for a reason to live<br>
> If you're looking for a reason I've a reason to give<br>
> Pleasure, little treasure

Is it capable of giving you meaning? Will your abuse sustain your life through? A little treasure, indeed.
