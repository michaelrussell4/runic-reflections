> Fingerprints found but are mistaken for tarnish<br>
> Great works abound but evade capturing harness<br>
> All else but be known these do for his cause<br>
> Only for the crown all obey his laws<br>
> Hidden behind clouds his light doth shine<br>
> Bidden to stay lest man's mind doth find<br>
> Be it our place to hunger and thirst<br>
> Longing unanswered this is our curse<br>
> But for this confusion and impossible quest<br>
> His goodness displayed and existence manifest
