> Donny read as seconds ticked<br>
> A dialect long derelict<br>
> From dusty pages in a book<br>
> In perfidy he did look<br>
> For he saw it on his stroll<br>
> It caught his eye—rather droll<br>
> On its cover: a red dragoon<br>
> For his weapon: a pink balloon<br>
> Its binding made of svelte silk<br>
> Its pages color: creamy milk<br>
> Donny's fate would be known soon<br>
> They'd relegate him to his doom<br>
> Persistent clock said "tick, tock"<br>
> Perspired sweat fell drip, drop<br>
> A torpid guard who sat and snoozed<br>
> Would wake up soon and not amused<br>
> Would extirpate old daring Donny<br>
> A brute against one weak and scrawny<br>
> But Donny could not finish now<br>
> Cupidity would risk allow<br>
> Then there came a frightful sound<br>
> Footsteps pounding on the ground<br>
> The guard had woken and was near<br>
> His awful eyes on Donny stared<br>
> Donny pleaded searching pocket<br>
> What would he find—money, a locket?<br>
> The guard lurched forward looming near<br>
> And on his face: an impatient sneer<br>
> Donny revealed a pink balloon<br>
> With breath he filled it—subtle swoon<br>
> The guard came near causing fear<br>
> Donny uttered "Videris ut aper"<br>
> The balloon flew and hit the brute<br>
> While making the sound of a toot<br>
> Then the guard didn't look so big<br>
> Donny turned him into a pig
