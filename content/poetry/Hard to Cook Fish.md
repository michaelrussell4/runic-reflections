# Hard to Cook Fish

> A pair of fish, Jim caught him two<br>
"Well with these fish know what I'll do?"<br>
"Stick 'em in a pot and make a stew"<br>
But for two stones old Jim mistook them<br>
Took them home and then he cooked them<br>
Biting down his teeth fell out<br>
Thatâ€™s when he discovered rocks ain't trout
