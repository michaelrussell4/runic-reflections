> Odoriferous specters bear unwanted news<br>
> This inexorable fate I did not choose<br>
> The gavel has rapped<br>
> The devil he laughs<br>
> Futilely, the past I now muse<br>
> <br>
> Alas, dilatoriness exacerbates my pain<br>
> This bitter labor to feculence detain<br>
> A battle commences<br>
> Stinging my senses<br>
> An evil unsheathed fights again<br>
> <br>
> I grimace turning head‚Äîone eye closed<br>
> My fingers fight as an army composed<br>
> Excrement extinguished<br>
> The foe relinquished<br>
> The remains in white clothes I enclose<br>
> <br>
> In euphoric triumph I glee, I preen<br>
> Like athlete's ritual at a victory scene<br>
> My hands cleanly made<br>
> As if cleaning my blade<br>
> From the foul blood of a dragon mean
