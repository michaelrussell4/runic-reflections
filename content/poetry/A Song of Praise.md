> God Thou art good forever<br>
> Thy mercy streams like a river<br>
> Thy glory shines as rays of light<br>
> Giving life and warmth to creation<br>
> Thou hearest my prayers great or small<br>
> I'm left with no doubt that thine eye sees all<br>
> Sweet assurance to know I am known<br>
> With Thy love and grace am I overcome<br>
> Confidence abides in me faithful from Thee<br>
> Reign over all for eternity<br>
> Blessed God praise to Thy name<br>
> I praise Thee I honor Thee I worship Thee
