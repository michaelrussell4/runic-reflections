I lighted a fire with a match from my light pack since there was no light.
Next morning, I woke up wet and saw a well from which water welled, thinking "Well that's not good"
Drops of water also dropped from the clouds.
The water rose, covering the rose bushes.
A duck lead me to a led boat that could actually float.
So I rowed the boat through rows of waves.
