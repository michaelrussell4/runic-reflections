> I've got a plan<br>
> Yet also has the Man<br>
> Shall I keep my own<br>
> Or leave it to His throne?<br>
> Is my end to leave<br>
> My plans no more to cleave?<br>
> Or does he care<br>
> For wants I bear?<br>
> Is it better to submit?<br>
> To let go of all of it?<br>
> Do my pleas matter<br>
> Or be they vain chatter?<br>
> Shall I have wants none<br>
> Say always Thy will be done?<br>
> May I have desire<br>
> Or my full ego fire?
