> Old Mr. Blight was always right<br>
> He knew the name of every mite<br>
> He even knew every mountain's height<br>
> He could explain why crocodiles bite<br>
> Or tell about fossils like ammonites<br>
> Or how in the sky a kite could take flight<br>
> He even knew spooky sprites that fright<br>
> In forest glens when it's dark at night<br>
> Whose flight comes early with morning light<br>
> He knew the knots that are very tight<br>
> And how to beat a shark in a deadly fight<br>
> He could calculate the speed of a bird in flight<br>
> He knew the full story of the goblin Dwight<br>
> Who was killed in a fight by the great white knight<br>
> And he'd riddle off facts while he drank a Sprite<br>
> Slurping seltzer with great delight<br>
> But while fantastic knowledge he was given<br>
> One thing he never understood, and that was women
