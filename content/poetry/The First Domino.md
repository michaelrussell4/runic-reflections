Some have reasoned that there must be a first cause—a being outside of matter and time who started it all. They say this is an argument for God.

Theists and atheists alike are laden with the same predicament of this strange reality. Both can agree that its origin is mysterious and unknowable. If one assumes that a first cause must have occurred—and not all do—they often attempt to assuage themselves by labeling this dubious singularity a God or a scientific phenomenon. This they find satisfying in much the same way that psychologists and their clients find satisfaction in inventing names for conditions, despite having not found remedies for such. Labeling a problem with a name may be useful for reference but offers no explanation.

And are these fellows comfortable with the implications of their assumption—that a force outside of matter and time is able to interact with space and time? Granted, many in this camp have likely already assumed this problem of interaction when they asserted a dualistic nature of reality where immaterial spirit affects material matter. Why are such quick to assume that spirit is not matter?

I've mentioned that not all assume there must have been a first cause. It's true that for a chain of dominoes to fall in succession, a first cause is required—be it by a conscious hand or a natural force such as an earthquake. However, if the dominoes exist on a digital screen, a radical perspective shift occurs leaving discussions about first causers moot.

Individuals unfamiliar with digital technology might mistakenly postulate that magic or materialistic laws govern the interactions, were they to observe, as those of us accustomed to this technology might laugh in response. Such ignorant individuals may be intelligent, but they lack foundational knowledge and are left with unfortunate presuppositions leading them to errancy.

In the same way, might philosophers and religionists be speculating on the cause of our reality. Ignorant we are of our own minds, let alone, the universe in which we seem to live. We don't even understand enough to ask the questions that would give us the understanding we lack.
