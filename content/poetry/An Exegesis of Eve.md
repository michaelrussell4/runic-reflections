> “The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.” – Eve

Many are familiar with the bible’s account of the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Following the creation, a subtle serpent deceives Eve, leading to her partaking of forbidden fruit. After getting Adam to also partake, they both are cast out of this paradise: the fall of mankind. A modern tendency for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to reframe this narrative by suggesting that Eve was informed in her decision, even courageous and wise, rather than deceived. What is the basis for such a claim, and could it be true?

## 1. Egalitarianism and Modernity

One possible reason for this tendency is to reconcile contemporary egalitarian and feminist values with the ancient account identifying Eve as the victim of deception—suggesting gullibility or foolishness. For individuals perceiving this point as derogatory, flipping the scenario around and making the woman the hero—a modern Hollywood habit—feels more palatable.

### My response

This is a classic case of presentism—interpreting the past through a lens of modern values. The Old Testament texts are unambiguous that Eve was deceived. Paul confirms this interpretation in 1 Timothy 2 as does the Book of Mormon in Mosiah 16. There is no variance or inconsistency in the authoritative canon.

The discomfort some feel on this point does not give license to override the scriptural clarity and consistency.

## 2. Endowment Ceremony

In a sacred Temple ceremony called an Endowment, Latter-day Saints are immersed in a dramatization of the creation and fall narrative. While non-canonical, the script of this enactment has been used as support for an informed-Eve interpretation. Concerning the scene of Eve’s beguilement, early endowment accounts convey it simply: the devil solicits Eve to partake and she acquiesces. A change in 1879 depicts Eve demurring and recalling how God had commanded her not to. But she concedes when given the fruit.

So far, these provide no basis for an informed-Eve interpretation. They are consistent with scripture. However, in 1931, a change is made that develops the reasoning behind Eve’s decision. Upon the Devil’s first temptation, Eve recalls, “…Father said in the day we ate thereof we should surely die.” The Devil responds consistent with the biblical account, “Ye shall not surely die but ye shall be as the gods; ye shall know good from evil…” To this, Eve responds, “Is there no other way?” This line suggests the possibility that Eve wisely identified a necessity for their fall and partakes with informed decision.

### My response

The LDS Church’s canon is the “standard works”—Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price. Additionally, the First Presidency or Quorum of the Twelve occasionally offer official statements on doctrine or policy. The dramatization of the creation and fall in the Endowment ceremony is not canon or official doctrine.

If an important distinction of doctrine were to be offered by the church, it would not be delivered through this channel nor would it contradict the consistent teachings of the standard works.

## 3. Statements from Church Leaders

Church leaders, even Apostles and Prophets, have recently made statements that suggest Eve was informed. While not every statement made by an Apostle or Prophet can be taken as officially binding doctrine, this certainly can be used as support.

### My response

In this case, we must remember that new revelations will be consistent with the canonical scriptures. These opinions deviate significantly from a clear and consistent doctrine of scriptures. Many high-ranking church leaders have made or published statements that have since been identified as inconsistent with official doctrine.

## 4. Etymology and Eisegesis

A third method for the informed-Eve view is biblical interpretation. In English, “beguiled” can mean “charmed” or “enchanted”. Hence, readers argue that when Eve beguilement entailed being charmed by the Devil rather than deceived by him. Proponents might suggest how Eve was aware of the Devil’s lies and saw past them.

### My response

The fact that the modern English definition for “beguile” can mean “to charm or enchant” is irrelevant. In Hebrew, the word is nāšā', meaning “to beguile, deceive”. It consistently conveys “deception” throughout the Old Testament. Never does it suggest something less. Modern bible translations render nāšā' as “deceived” (see NIV and ESV). The English alternative interpretation is simply not available in the Hebrew.

When referred to by Paul in 1 Timothy 2:14, he says “Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in transgression.”

Logically, if “beguiled” meant “charmed but not deceived”, the sequence of events and Eve’s justification to God for why she partook lose coherence.

These reasons render this argument an untenable position.

## Conclusion

The deception of Eve is a fixed point in the standard works, supported by Hebrew etymology and cross-testamental commentary. No canonical ambiguity exists to support the "informed-Eve" hypothesis. This modern reinterpretation relies on cultural presentism rather than scriptural or logical data. Deviating from the literal deception narrative fundamentally alters the doctrine of the Fall and sets a dangerous precedent where well-supported Christian doctrines can be rewritten based on changing cultural views.
