> Once I lived in harmony<br>
> Love and beauty were had and given<br>
> Purpose was tacet<br>
> Creativity within<br>
> <br>
> I fell and I fell<br>
> Fallen in Hell<br>
> No love just consumption<br>
> No beauty exploitation<br>
> Purpose—none; numb<br>
> Creativity run faint<br>
> <br>
> Can you mend broken glass?<br>
> Repair a heart turgid and torn?<br>
> Weeds and thorns choke it fast<br>
> Vessel for this misery borne
