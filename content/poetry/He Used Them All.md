## Notes

I just tried to use a ton of words I've "learned" recently but am forgetting. Trying to keep my memory of them fresh. Here's a version of the poem with substitution meanings of the learned words. The name refers to me, who used all the words. And it also refers to whomever this violent tyrant is of whom the poem speaks.

> A imaginery figure containing the leader of hope<br>
> Awakening hope from the bullying archetype<br>
> Whose rude and violent dominance destroys life<br>
> His whimsical lust we met with strife<br>
> Brown remains, dull and dead were produced<br>
> After rotten perfumes were by him induced<br>
> Such meticulous precision at work<br>
> Devastating farm fortune with a smirk<br>
> Deadly his traits and humble our protection<br>
> A destroyed and deteriorated land and our sorrwful wages<br>
> Now at the twilightish, alleviating view<br>
> My weary soul won over by its beauty
