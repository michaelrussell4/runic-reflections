# The girl who played in the forest

> Once during the early summer in woodlands far away<br>
A young girl left her cottage outside she went to play<br>
As she walked out to the woods she sang and skipped around<br>
Just then she stopped because she heard a quiet buzzing sound<br>
It stopped just as she felt an itch upon her little arm<br>
Slapped the bug dead and then she said, "It won't cause me any harm"<br>
But soon her arm began to itch which bothered her a lot<br>
To help with that she got some mud and put it on the spot<br>
The mud relieved her of the itch but made a filthy mess<br>
To her joy she found a stream at which she shouted "Yes"<br>
Down she bent to wash her arm and cleaned the mud away<br>
Then she thought that in the stream she'd jump and run and play<br>
The water splashed and got her wet then came a chilly air<br>
She shivered but when turning round saw a giant bear<br>
The bear let out an awful growl that blew like gusts of wind<br>
This dried her off from head to toes and away she then did send<br>
She ran so fast and far from there for fear had filled her chest<br>
But the bear stayed beind "He wanted a drink" is what she guessed<br>
Though the girl was safe and dry she smelled like bad bear breath<br>
The smell was bad and she plugged her nose and started walking west<br>
She found herself in a meadow with flowers of every kind<br>
Now instead of the stinky breath this lovely smell refined<br>
West was where her home was, at least that's what she thought<br>
But as she looked around herself she realized it was not<br>
Lost and scared she kneeled to pray in that beautiful meadow<br>
She prayed and asked for help to find which way she ought to go<br>
Just then a bird flew from a tree and told her "Follow me"<br>
She ran and chased to answer the birds beckoning plea<br>
Over the hill and through a forest she followed the birds flight<br>
Until it led her to her home to her wonderful delight<br>
She thanked the bird and God above that she was home at last<br>
She went inside back to her mom and then she held her fast<br>
