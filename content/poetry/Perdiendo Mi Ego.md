# Perdiendo mi Ego

> With mi amigo Ego I tango<br>
A clingy thing he won't let go<br>
His weight I carry with strain<br>
His sustenance is my pain<br>
I used to think us great friends<br>
But knew not to what awful ends<br>
Our companionship costs me loads<br>
My slow death his hunger forbodes<br>
So I'm seeking to lose my Ego<br>
To find a new Friend. Here we go

## Notes

### Matthew 10:39

> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
