> The captive pig may live in peace<br>
> As bliss and gluttony increase<br>
> Until his master marks his fate<br>
> Better not to anticipate<br>
> The pig's dull mind is unaware<br>
> Of anxiety this him does spare<br>
> But cursed man with cunning fear<br>
> Must face his fate and see it clear<br>
> He knows he'll die, he wonders why<br>
> He might embrace it or deny<br>
> Some fools seek to live like swine<br>
> Fleeing fears with pleasure divine<br>
> With facts of fate they cannot err<br>
> Death comes nearer with his stare
