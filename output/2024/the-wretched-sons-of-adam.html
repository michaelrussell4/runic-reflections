        <blockquote>
<p>A wild man born into tribulation<br>
Works his life to improve his station<br>
He feeds his needs with strength of hand<br>
Hunting beasts with a chosen band<br>
<br>
His son improves a shelter secure<br>
His gains are found with rope and lure<br>
A family protected, a future perceived<br>
Tomorrow exists; thought is acheived<br>
<br>
Wealth is gained by domestication<br>
Growth ensues on a furtile foundation<br>
Children are reared and carefully taught<br>
Money's invented and merchandise bought<br>
<br>
"Perhaps", thinks man exercising his brain<br>
"We could elude hunger, toils, and pain"<br>
This thought led to action<br>
And soon it gained traction<br>
<br>
Year after year inventions were made<br>
Wells issued water with bucket and braid<br>
Beasts of burden plowed the field<br>
Smiths forged tools for man to wield<br>
<br>
But an odd thing happened with each improvement<br>
These tools for man did not still his movement<br>
He hadn't more rest nor absense of worry<br>
Always in a hurry his thoughts in a scurry<br>
<br>
Even more to add to this<br>
His learning threatened to steal his bliss<br>
For as man slowly tamed his brawn<br>
His mind would reason from dusk to dawn<br>
<br>
"Why do we work‚Äîwhy do we play?"<br>
"All is vanity at the end of day."<br>
"What I took as a child magic to be"<br>
"Seems more so now like machinery."<br>
<br>
As man's burdens were lightened<br>
All the more his mind frightened<br>
His soul wore new manacle<br>
His heart grew mechanical<br>
<br>
With softened skin and hardened soul<br>
Dead eyes that none could console<br>
He'd watch with pain<br>
The children playing<br>
<br>
"Oh how they frolic" said he<br>
"Those young, poor fools cannot see"<br>
"If they only knew how empty life was"<br>
"Then they might give their play pause"<br>
<br>
He snidely snarked in smug misery<br>
As the children laughed and played with glee<br>
That day the man died a poor genius<br>
As the children explored rocks on venus<br>
<br>
The children grew up and matured<br>
But their reality was blurred<br>
Figments of their former fantasy<br>
Revived with life to threaten their sanity<br>
<br>
Against better knowledge they saw<br>
Supernatural sightings forced rueful awe<br>
Doubt vied reason wreaking terrible treason<br>
What uncertain times came with this new season<br>
<br>
War and sickness truth and lie<br>
Questions were asked wondering why<br>
Wrestling souls fraught with dissonance<br>
Angst of curiousity makes a mighty impetus<br>
<br>
Poor creatures changed their outside<br>
But a poison festered inside<br>
Though work and toil were almost gone<br>
Their misery lived on and on<br>
<br>
Such is the state of those who are dead<br>
No solace no answers only dread<br>
It's not the body nor mind of course<br>
But a heart disconnected from its life Source</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This poem chronicles man's efforts to save himself from his own misery. He thinks that removing his burdens and pains will soothe his psyche but, alas, his God-hunger lives on. He cannot be complete without his Connection and Life. See hints to different ages of man: stone, byzantine, industrial, etc.</p>
