> What a good thing it is to sing<br>
> What power your voice can bring<br>
> A charming ring<br>
> A poignant sting<br>
> Maybe, if you're good, some money (cha-ching)<br>
> <br>
> You can even sing if you're a king<br>
> You can make a sound like a bell: ding<br>
> Dance the swing<br>
> Fling rocks with a sling<br>
> But make sure while you do it you sing<br>
> <br>
> Even the birds with wings like to sing<br>
> They chirp out their bright warbling<br>
> Whether winter or spring<br>
> At work or worshiping<br>
> You can sing, you can sing, you can sing
