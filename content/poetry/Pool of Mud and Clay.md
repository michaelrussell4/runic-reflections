> He's a pool of mud and clay<br>
> Fisherman fish all day<br>
> Tweeker's have time to play<br>
> Drink with the devil<br>
> Redneckery revel<br>
> A pig whose life's in flux<br>
> That slapping monkey sucks

# Notes

An homage to [Les Claypool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Claypool), a man whose ideas, beliefs, and lifestyles I'm sure to find revolting, yet whose music is fascinating. Each line has a least one reference to his life and works. This misshappen limerick reflects his weird unorthodoxy.
