> If your eye is dry, try to cry<br>
> When you cry your eye won't be dry<br>
> But if you sigh when you try<br>
> Because you fail to cry and wet your eye<br>
> You could look upwards high in the sky<br>
> If rain drops fly down to your eye<br>
> But if the rain has gone bye bye<br>
> There's another thing you can try<br>
> Find a pie and a bad guy<br>
> Then when he's nigh be very sly<br>
> And to his face give the pie a shy<br>
> He might by wondering why<br>
> Then he'll taste it and say "Me oh my!"<br>
> Maybe you'll laugh so hard you cry<br>
> Then your eyes won't be dry<br>
> Another idea is to eat a fry<br>
> Dipped in sauce hot as July<br>
> If you don't like spicy stuff you'll cry<br>
> But if all these ideas go awry<br>
> And you still have two dry eyes<br>
> You'll be so sad that you'll reply<br>
> By crying, "Why oh why oh why oh why?"<br>
> And when you do this tears will slide<br>
> Down your faceâ€”your eyes won't be dry
