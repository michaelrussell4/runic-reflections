> Is belief a virtue<br>
Or a product of one's facts?<br>
Do we honor a man's psychosis<br>
Or praise a mental relapse?<br>
For man to follow reason<br>
Expecting truth persistent<br>
Cannot be spiritual treason<br>
Shan't all law be consistent?<br>
Conviction takes convincing<br>
Persuasion from evidencing<br>
It's not too much to ask<br>
It's quite a simple task<br>
I won't reject the voice<br>
If it visits me<br>
I'll gladly wait to hear it<br>
Whether or not I see
