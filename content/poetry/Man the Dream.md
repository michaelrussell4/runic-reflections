> Man is just as a dream<br>
His beginning unknown<br>
In confusion he roams<br>
Reliably he will be<br>
Wreaking hellish abomination<br>
Or benevolent divinity<br>
Bringing beauty, love, joy, and peace<br>
Or fearful tremor abounding<br>
His being will continue<br>
On living he must go<br>
His end may be sudden<br>
As a recollection

## Meaning & Commentary

Man's experience is like a dream. He can bring about violence and evil or beauty and peace. But his species goes on living. Perhaps his end will be as awakening from a dreamâ€”sudden and surprising.
