> What is good and what is bad?<br>
> Which exists when suffering's had?<br>
> <br>
> A lion tortures his prey while eating<br>
> Flesh is torn with heart still beating<br>
> <br>
> A rodent feasts upon its child<br>
> Innocence looks on, beguiled<br>
> <br>
> Struggle of pain<br>
> Nature's name<br>
> Yet from these scourges<br>
> Beauty emerges<br>
> <br>
> A fawn takes a drink from a stream<br>
> Sunlight looks on, glistening<br>
> <br>
> Flowers bloom with sweet perfumes<br>
> Birds perform their melodic tunes<br>
> <br>
> What shall we say, whether good or bad?<br>
> These care not whether you're sad or glad

# Notes

Forgive me for mentioning the harsh facts of reality. Nature may exhibit beauty and pleasantries, but it also delivers ugliness and pain. Apparently, such opposition produces the color palate God's used to paint this earth.
