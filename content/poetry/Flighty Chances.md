> Do you agree with me? There's a chance that this could be<br>
> At night when no one watches pigs fly up by the moon?<br>
> Absurd, you say—they have no wings. But here's no difficulty<br>
> Does lack of wings prevent from flight bubbles or balloons?<br>

> The chance, unlike our porcine friends, is really rather slim<br>
> However, you cannot prove with certainty your point is really right<br>
> Proving a negative is very hard—your chances very grim<br>
> So I say that pigs just might be able to take flight
