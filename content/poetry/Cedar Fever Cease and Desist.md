> Dear Mountain Cedar,<br>
> Ancient and strong you are it's true<br>
> In soil so dry it's amazing you grew<br>
> Your women are fair—blue berries in their hair<br>
> I wish this was all that I had to share<br>
> Forgive me now, but to be forthright<br>
> Your men have a habit which causes spite<br>
> On cold wintry days when the winds pick up<br>
> Their poisonous bombs begin to blow up<br>
> A yellow smoke of haze abounds<br>
> Then coughs and sneezes are heard all around<br>
> For this cause I bring to your attention<br>
> A complaint to resolve—intention for prevention<br>
> I beg you now—cease and desist<br>
> With best regards, I must insist<br>
><br>
> — the human folk
