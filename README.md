# Runic Relics

Welcome to **Runic Relics**! This is a digital collection of poetry created by **Mike**. Here, you will find a variety of poems that explore themes of spirituality, philosophy, and linguistic creativity.

## About

The purpose of **Runic Relics** is to share my thoughts and expressions through poetry. My reasons for writing vary; sometimes I aim to express complex themes or philosophical dilemmas, while other times I simply want to play with new words I've learned. The collection includes poems that are mysterious or dark, as well as those that are comical or silly. My hope is that by making these works accessible, I can share my unique perspective and inspire appreciation and enjoyment.

## How the Site Works

I built **Runic Relics** using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator that transforms simple Markdown files into a polished website. Each poem begins as a Markdown file, allowing me to focus on the words themselves. With a simple `git push`, I can bring new creations to life on the site. As a professional coder, building this website was a fun project that combined my skills and interests.

## Explore the Collection

Feel free to explore the site, reflect on the poems, and enjoy this evolving collection of verses. I hope these poems inspire thought, spark curiosity, or simply bring a smile.
