> We create reality with our collective consciousness.

Different versions of this theory exist, sharing the idea that a collective consciousness influences reality. New-Agers, Jungian disciples, and arm-chair philosophers alike provoke such theories, tossing in vague references to quantum physics or ancient religious thought. Admittedly, it's an appealing ideaâ€”tasty to minds plagued with ravenous curiosity about existential mysteries; such whose fingers sift metaphysical desert sands, grasping for meaning; whose desperation for such welcomes meager morsels, lacking parsimony and mental rigor not for vernacular ostentation, rather by habit or ignorance.

Being facetious, for the record ðŸ˜‰

But in all seriousness (â€¦\[ambiguous pause for humor indigestible by most]â€¦), what about this idea? If everyone believed in Santa would he poof into existenceâ€”mutating our reality in some kind of temporally omnidirectional explosion? Turns outâ€”all a suddenâ€”he's always really existed, accounted for by ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs ([shout-out to Stalking Santa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811082/)), Smithsonian artifacts, and the Fibonacci sequence. Or other things, too. If we all started believing in dragons, they'd poof into existence.

If this were true, it could explain the alleged myths of loreâ€”fairies, angels, demons, dragons, etc. These would have all been local, temporary productions of the collective believes of past human societies. Enthusiasts' hands start flying, slamming the ontological puzzle pieces together to create a sensible view of our universe; e.g., the Hindus really did see those multi-armed blue people, the Greco-Romans their gods, UFO sightings may have been legitimate, and so on.

We do run into the head-scratcher of how supposed realities could be harmonized. We couldn't each be experiencing fundamentally different realities, right? Your world couldn't be Star Wars while mine is boring old 19th-century materialismâ€”you couldn't be a woman in yours while being a man in mine ðŸ™‰. Those are incompatible realities. A collective-consciousness apologist, wanting and wishing, might suggest that while local disparate realities may simultaneously exist as long as they don't interact. But when they doâ€”whammo!â€”quantum wave function collapses (whatever we mean by that), and the two realities snap into a single reality, pruning out incompatibilities.

However, this feature of thought feels more uncomfortable than our usual existential angst we had before entertaining this bright, prospective solution. And how many people does it take to make a collective capable of curating local/global realities? One, two, twelve, forty two? At what point can you start affecting realities and materializing unicorns?

Don't worry, New-Agers, I can hear you attempting to placate my doubts with talk of levels of consciousness, frequencies, etc. Perhaps monks, psi inheritors, and out-of-body thrill seekers who focus their brain energy as theta-wave frequencies have increased power. Maybe these guys are so powerful they can make strange things happen on their own like Harry Potter. Maybe they can even manifest that pink convertible that's been on their vision board since they read [The Secret](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52529.The_Secret).

Christ or God, I suppose, would be the ultimate exhibitors of this phenomenon, whose god-mode consciousness levels are capable of overwhelming any combating influences allowing him to exert his will with ease. Whether he would be hindered by anything, such as the free will of his subjects, would be another discussion tangent to this discussion.

We may as well throw in simulation theory at this point. It meshes nicely with the consciousness matrix. I mean, we're so abstract and virtual at this point that most of us aren't even sure what we're talking about anymore. It's only fitting to bring up other speculative obscurities we haven't yet found a place for. We continue our performance by conjecturing that consciousness projects realities are mini simulations. And maybe there's some base reality in which our consciousness resides. Let's just say it's a boundless hyper-sphere or something like that while we're at it. And when it interacts with this lowly three-dimensional reality we only get a reduced component of the original. However, by focusing our brain waves we can get more effective interactionsâ€”more surface area contact with space-time, and more concentration.

Well, where do we go from here? It's been fun to talk. Let's wake up from this dream and face the cold hard reality, indiscernible, lifeless, and emptyâ€”Nietzsche's unbearable world. However, I don't blame you if you'd rather not.
