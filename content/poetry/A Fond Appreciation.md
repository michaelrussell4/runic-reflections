> I remarked to my wife, my dear<br>
> As for celebration and cheer<br>
> My precious, my friend, my love<br>
> How I've cherished this time, my dove<br>
> You've been at my side<br>
> We've laughed, we've cried<br>
> We've seen quite a lot<br>
> Much joy you have brought<br>
> How wonderful life is with you<br>
> Whether good or gloomy and blue<br>
> I prefer to spend it together<br>
> Let God us eternally tether<br>
> My angel and beloved wife<br>
> My joy, my heart, my life<br>
> Her response as she looked in my eyes<br>
> You know what she said? "Likewise"
