> A pursuit, a treasure<br>
> The wind blows I wither<br>
> Father how wanting<br>
> I've sought Thee forever<br>
> Beneath autumn trees<br>
> On sundry days<br>
> I fall to my knees<br>
> Wind presses in waves<br>
> Spring offering hope<br>
> I seek renewed<br>
> Water traces its slope<br>
> Why this so crude<br>
> What barrier between<br>
> Us flees my vision<br>
> My heart yearns on<br>
> Hope not derision<br>
> A sumpter am I<br>
> for weariness weighs<br>
> My aging eye<br>
> Yet lingering I stay
