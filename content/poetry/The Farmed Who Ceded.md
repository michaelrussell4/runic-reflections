> A farmer once ceded that land he'd seeded<br>
> His wife proceeded to intercede<br>
> He had to concede, or she'd secede<br>
> But they hadn't the money to proceed<br>
> For a time, the man receded<br>
> They went to the bank—the wife preceded<br>
> She asked for a loan, the bank acceded<br>
> Their land's value, their loan exceeded<br>
> They bought it back, the farmer then weeded<br>
