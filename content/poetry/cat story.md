What a day had Mary Mae!
She woke up and her little toe was gray
She asked the doctor to take a look
Surprised, he said, "I'll consult my books"
He scanned through pages, "Aha! I know"
"You have Apathosis of the toe"
Mary gasped in fear and grief
"What's the solution? I need relief!"
The doctor replied with a calm and certain tone:
"Your little toe's likely sad to the bone"
Mary Mae squinted her eyes in surprise
"Can a toe have feelings on this wise?"
The doctor explained the science of toes
"They can feel and even singâ€”one study shows"
Mary acquiesced to this newfound knowledge
Even though she never learned it in college
Mary asked if and how to get well
The doctor said, "Ah yes, let me tell"
"Normally, a person's toes are fine"
"They won't argue or fight or whine"
"But every once in a while, you see"
"A toe or two becomes angry"
Mary asked, "How does that occur?"
"Honestly", said the doctor, "I'm not sure"
"What I'll have to do," the doctor went on
"Is refer you to a specialist who speaks Toe-song"
"They'll speak with your toe to find the cause"
"And get you feeling good as you ever was"
