> I lighted a fire with a match from my light pack since there was no light.<br>
> Next morning, I woke up wet and saw a well from which water welled, thinking "Well that's not good"<br>
> Drops of water also dropped from the clouds.<br>
> The water rose, covering the rose bushes.<br>
> A duck lead me to a led boat that could actually float.<br>
> So I rowed the boat through rows of waves.<br>
