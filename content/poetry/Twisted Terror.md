> Once I lived in harmony
> Love and beauty were had and given
> Purpose was tacet
> Creativity within
> <br>
> I fell and I fell
> Fallen in Hell
> No love just consumption
> No beauty exploitation
> Purposeâ€”none; numb
> Creativity run faint
> <br>
> Can you mend broken glass?
> Repair a heart turgid and torn?
> Weeds and thorns choke it fast
> Vessel for this misery borne
