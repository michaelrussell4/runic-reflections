> If a perfect God exists, then a sincere seeker of truth would not be left without adequate awareness of him. Yet, there exist sincere, non-resistant individuals who lack adequate awareness of him. Therefore, such a God can not exist.

Such goes the "Hidden God" argument. What it wrongly assumes is that knowledge and belief in God result from intellectual exercise. They mistake in thinking that if the proposition of God is true, they must be able to deduce it *a priori* or by studying the books of the learned theologians and philosophers. Good thing they're wrong, or belief in God—this virtue, would be restricted to a select class of intellectuals. The ignorant, unlearned, or untrained would be unfairly disadvantaged, making heaven an aristocracy.

Fortunately, such elitism is not God's way. The meek and simple, but straight and narrow, is unlocked by obedience.

John 7:17

> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

Doctrine & Covenants 93:28

> He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.

Not only does understanding require faith and obedience, for the wise and prudent—the educated and elite, it may require a setting aside the ways of the world:

Matthew 11:25

> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

This being said, it's important to note that this response does not address the inaccessibility of scriptures such as these to many a man. But in touching on anticipated responses, I'll highlight that the suggestion that obedience is required to know God may sound like circular reasoning to some—e.g., you must accept divine authority to gain awareness of divine authority. This is the process of the scientific method: you begin with a hypothesis and test whether it is true or not. If one is unwilling to entertain a hypothesis and put forth the above-prescribed effort to prove it one way or another, he cannot say he has truly tried or ruled it out.
