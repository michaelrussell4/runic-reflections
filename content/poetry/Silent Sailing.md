> A sedate sailor with lugubrious crew<br>
Longed for esprit and comradery<br>
A euphonious shantyâ€”he thought it'd do<br>
So with lupine timbre he hummed audibly<br>
<br>
He merrily sung towards felicity<br>
His mates swelled in cuasticity<br>
The feller was soon accosted by one<br>
A quixotic toper by barrel of gun<br>
<br>
The captain appeared smelling of rancor<br>
The sailors stared at incipient danger<br>
The warbler thinked and he thought<br>
The others finked and they fought<br>
<br>
So now they sail in silence<br>
