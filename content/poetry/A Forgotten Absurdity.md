> Not a blissful ignorance is this to me<br>
No less this amnesia than treachery<br>
You might severe my right arm just as well<br>
A stolen memory makes a living hell<br>
You may placate my fears and soothe my needs<br>
You may offer me fancies and liberty<br>
Yet I will not relent but further accent<br>
My plea to thee is for sympathy<br>
Are you pulling my leg or playing a joke?<br>
Is the misfortune entertaining of this poor bloke?<br>
Or perhaps it may be though difficult to see<br>
That this path I have chosen before I was me?<br>
I hope it's a good reason<br>
Until curiosityâ€™s next season<br>
I'll count it not fell<br>
And bid thee farewell
