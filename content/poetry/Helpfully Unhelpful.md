<span class="leading-none block text-left">Sir, can you not help me?</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">It depends on what you mean</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Of course, you do not have to</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">Your intentions are not keen</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">I won't say I don't want your help</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">Whatever is your plea?</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Now I see that I'm a bother</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">In this I must agree</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Well perhaps I might just ask</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">Please do it if you must</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Will you, won't you, can't you, sir</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">You're earning my disgust</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Oh nevermind, the time has past</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">At this I'm quite relieved</span><br>
<span class="leading-none block text-left">Oh good, I'm glad; you are not mad</span><br>
<span class="pl-16 leading-none block text-right">Quite a turnaround you've achieved</span>
