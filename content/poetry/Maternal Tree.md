> My mom's like a tree<br>
> Her fruit nourishes me<br>
> She shades me from the heat<br>
> In her bosom I retreat<br>
> Like leaves her hair surrounds her face<br>
> So soft and soothing her embrace<br>
> On her strong frame I rest my weighed down heart<br>
> A stable foundation she'll never depart<br>
> The deeper I look the more complex her design<br>
> And in the morning light her beauty doth shine<br>
> Endowed with power of making new life<br>
> God's gift to the world: a mother, a wife<br>
> As trees unite heaven and earth<br>
> My mother too, so great her worth
