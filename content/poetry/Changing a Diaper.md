Odoriferous specters bear unwanted news
This inexorable fate I did not choose
The gavel has rapped
The devil he laughs
Futilely, the past I now muse

Alas, dilatoriness exacerbates my pain
This bitter labor to feculence detain
A battle commences
Stinging my senses
An evil unsheathed fights again

I grimace turning headâ€”one eye closed
My fingers fight as an army composed
Excrement extinguished
The foe relinquished
The remains in white clothes I enclose

In euphoric triumph I glee, I preen
Like athlete's ritual at a victory scene
My hands cleanly made
As if cleaning my blade
From the foul blood of a dragon mean
