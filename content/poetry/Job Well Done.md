## Notes

This poem is about the Biblical character Job. He suffers, he petitions, and the answer that comes doesn't really address the [poignent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poignant) moral qualms Job had argued. Nevertheless, Job seems contented and the Lord rewards him seven-fold for all his losses. At the beginning, "pine" is used in the sense of being worn away or wearied, but in the latter use it infers the meaning of yearning, rather.
