> Caliginous chaotic smog corrupts the petrichor<br>
A semaphore's numinous ritual ensues<br>
Inscrutable gestures mistaken for whimsy<br>
A soliloquy delivered in a nebulous tongue<br>
Addressing that which almost evades perception<br>
A sensory penumbra from dimensions unknown<br>
Reveals an ethereal presence at last<br>
Light beams, meaning seethes<br>
The music settles to a hum, the dance undone<br>
What was living dies and the dead come alive<br>
Desert sands undergird an enigmatic sphinx<br>
Guarding from mutation and perversion<br>
Arbitration forced order who now reigns supreme
