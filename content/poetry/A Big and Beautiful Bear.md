# A Big and Beautiful Bear

> Poor Callisto, you're stuck in a rut<br>
Stewn in the sky with a cup for a butt<br>
Once beheld as a beautiful sight<br>
Now you're an ursine beast of the night<br>
Lustful eyes cloaked with disguise<br>
Jupiter's deeds were your demise<br>
Once your fairness love brought forth<br>
Now wayfarers your rump guides north<br>
Whether by gods or man or cow<br>
You were looked on then and still are now
