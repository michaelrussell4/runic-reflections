Again I find myself within
Edifice of the ghoul and djinn
Strange fantasms, traps and chasms
Doleful creatures, ectoplasms
Furtively, I hide and flee
Futilely, we all agree
No fear but curiosity
Odd: my phobic callosity
A familiar clairvoyance
A slight annoyance
I've been there so often
Perhaps it's my coffin

## Notes

Based on a strange dream I must have had at least 10 times in my lifeâ€”I'm in a haunted house. I explore the strange paranormal phenomena and I usually hide and run from some of the evil forces. The odd thing is that I don't recall ever feeling scared.
