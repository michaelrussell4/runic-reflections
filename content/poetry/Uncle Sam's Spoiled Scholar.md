> A wealthy man whose name was Sam<br>
> Had many children in his land<br>
> He favored them with silver and gold<br>
> Generous gifts for them to hold<br>
> One son dear received the most<br>
> Whose deeds were worthy for to boast<br>
> This son's kingdom grew and grew<br>
> With it his subjects multiplied, too<br>
> But came a day when contention lay<br>
> A hatred in the land did sway<br>
> Some gathered together to despise<br>
> Their victim brothers let out cries<br>
> But their king gave no protection<br>
> Their souls succumbed to abjection<br>
> Sam looked on his son's misdeed<br>
> <br>
> "Son they're calling to your need"<br>
> <br>
> But these words his son defied<br>
> For he had grown stiff with pride<br>
> This offense left Sam amiss<br>
> This son he'd given greatest gifts<br>
> <br>
> "If he shall to evil bend"<br>
> "My support will cease and end"<br>
> <br>
> These, Sam's words, he told his son<br>
> Who's anger roused, his mind undone<br>
> <br>
> "How dare you, Father, do this to me?"<br>
> "It's not fair, it's not you see!"<br>
> "I deserve it still, I do"<br>
> "You gave before, here continue"<br>
> "My freedom will you take away?"<br>
> "You are not fair, it's mine, okay?"<br>
> "I will go and do my will"<br>
> "You'll keep giving money, still"<br>
> <br>
> Sam responded in authority<br>
> <br>
> "My son you are in errancy"<br>
> "You are free to choose your way"<br>
> "As I am, too, from day to day"<br>
> "I will not support an evil cause"<br>
> "I will uphold the righteous laws"<br>
> "I will protect they who are just"<br>
> "I will defend them, yes I must"<br>
> "If you choose to them neglect"<br>
> "And your ways not to correct"<br>
> "You are free to do this thing"<br>
> "But no longer will money I bring"<br>
> "It was a gift for my good son"<br>
> "But not to do evil‚Äîthis I shun"<br>
> <br>
> Who is just in this tale told?<br>
> Must Sam support his son with gold?<br>
> Methinks his son is likened to<br>
> A spoiled brat with judgement skewed
