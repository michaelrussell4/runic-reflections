## Meaning & Commentary

This exercise was difficult for me. This poem is my first attempt to at least loosely follow the skaldic poetic form of the ancient Celtic/Icelandic people. It's notorious for its complexity and difficulty to write. This example follows these rules:

* 4 line pairs (8 lines total)
* Each line has 6 syllables
* Each line contains an internal rhyme (shown here in <ins>underline</ins>)
* Each of the line pairs contain 3 alliterated words (shown here in **bold**)
* Use of kennings, which are elaborate metaphors where a simple word is replaced with a complex phrase describing its attributes; e.g., "hanged god" is Odin (Odin hanged himself for nine days from the world tree, Yggdrasil, in his quest for more knowledge); "Ymir's skull" is the sky (the jöttun’s skull created the heavens).

The meaning of this poem centers on the search for knowledge—Odin's thirst. The search includes looking for wisdom (personified as a woman as in the Jewish Proverbs) in the sky and the sea. Being unsatisfied is painful, as a heart cut out.

The title is a play on the icelandic word for knowledge—þekking, pronounced roughly as "theh-king".
