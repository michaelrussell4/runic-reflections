> A mute man strolled along a stream
> When caught his eye a brilliant gleam
> Never a word had this man spoken
> A curse which soon would be broken
>
> He dove on down into the blue
> He grasped around without ado
> He held it fast for to acquire
> He held it up: a blue saphire
>
> What a whorf was this
> This pleasant walk of bliss
> Is what this man would shriek
> If he could only speak
>
> But as he held the stone
> While he was all alone
> A noise quite like a voice
> Started to rejoice
>
> This man was mute no more
> Words from his mouth did pour
> And then to his surprise
> The saphire grew in size
>
> Bigger, bigger, split
> It multiplied a bit
> His wealth it grew and grew
> As well as what he knew
>
> For with his language came
> More knowledge to his brain
> He shared it all with others
> His sisters and his brothers
