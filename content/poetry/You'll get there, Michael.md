> How do you get there, Michael?<br>
> Do you drive a motorcycle?<br>
> Or rather a pedal-powered cycle?<br>
> Can you race and beat your rival?<br>
> Have you armed yourself with rifle?<br>
> You do what you do for survival<br>
> Don't you forget to recycle<br>
> Better yet to read the Bible<br>
> Before you make your arrival<br>
> That's how you'll get there, Michael
