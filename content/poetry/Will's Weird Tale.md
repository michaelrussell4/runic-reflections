> William Wilson was called Will<br>
> He walked by side of a wagon wheel<br>
> When he found a well with water well<br>
> He drank as much as a weary whale<br>
> What welcomed warmth in him did swell<br>
> When a whispered word he heard one tell<br>
> "Wist ye not this water ain't well?"<br>
> From a withered old man with appearance frail<br>
> Will turned pale with a wretched chill<br>
> Then he waned and waddled back to the wheel<br>
> Where he walked and walked and walked until<br>
> He felt quick sick and then he fell<br>
> The wilting heat on him did rail<br>
> He knew death soon would him avail<br>
> But then a whale rolled down a hill<br>
> And squirted water which felt swell<br>
> Woke Will when water on him fell<br>
> With wonder at this giant whale<br>
> The whale then gaped and swalled Will<br>
> Will then made a stinky smell<br>
> Which the whale could not endure to dwell<br>
> So he spit out Will on a hill by a quail<br>
> Who said that he could call her Belle
