# A Christ Mass Dance

> From the northern pole a pipe was played<br>
The elves, the stars, in regalia arrayed<br>
Danced in rhythm round the piper's tune<br>
With hands linked fast‚Äîa melodic swoon<br>
In crimson cloth, their benefactor dear<br>
Raised his hands and called all to hear<br>
"A yuletide carol now sing with me"<br>
And he closed his eyes counting "1, 2, 3"<br>
"Hooray for the light of this joyful season"<br>
"Which warms our hearts and gives us reason"<br>
"To overcome darkness with joy and giving"<br>
"And brighten the day of all things living"<br>
"I love to receive and I love to give"<br>
"I love to be forgiven and let mercy live"<br>
"My beard is white as the snow so bright"<br>
"My burden I bear with a sack not so light"<br>
"The day soon comes and I can hardly wait!"<br>
"So it is with my precious reindeer eight"<br>
"Three elves on the north, west, south, and east"<br>
"Let us carry on now with a Santa feast"<br>
The elves heard and sang as they followed along<br>
To the joyful words of Santa's new song<br>
When the song was over they all settled down<br>
They soon would go home to their wintery town<br>
Knowing bedtime was near from the clock's ticktock<br>
At home they'd wait for the "knock, knock, knock"<br>
When each elf was given a gift in his hand<br>
A tradition well known in the white and magic land

## Notes

At the risk of committing sacrilege, this poem incorporates veiled references to certain Christian rites apparently performed by the early Gnostic Christians but does so under a guise which appears quite innocuous, even fun and juvenile. Perhaps this poem could be read for children around the Christmas season with a fun, more cryptic theme for those who have ear to hear.

For a more direct reference to my hidden allusions, the [Acts of John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_John), a dance is danced and a song is sung at the direction of the high priest, the piper. Gestures, gifts, and attire are of especial pertinence. "He that hath an ear, let him hear".
