# Departure of Faith

> Walk ye warily from thy faith<br>
Except thou hath a better way<br>
Lest thou meet the wretched wraith<br>
Who taketh thy soul for prey<br>
Thy kin look down with pity and dread<br>
Upon thine earnest endeavor<br>
Quixotic be this path ye tread<br>
The cost for you to be clever
