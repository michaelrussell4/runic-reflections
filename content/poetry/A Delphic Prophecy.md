## Notes

This poem tells of a journey which has an undesirable start but which may either worsen or improve depending on the reading. While it starts out hinting at an evil trick or ploy that has resulted in a cloven heart and pain, some movement may either redeem the victim from this miserable plane or it may be the evil hand itself with holds fast (still) and not fast (quickly) from/in this hell. The poem plays around with the concept of [contronyms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contranym) which are words having two meanings that contradict each other. In this poem, `sanction` may mean "to approve or authorize something" or "to punish someone". `Cleave` may mean "to join or adhere closely" or "to split or separate".

I named it "A Delphic Prophecy" because the Oracle of Delphi would utter prophecies with varying prophetic accuracy. I see that sometimes fortunes can be told in such a vague way as to allow fulfillment through various interpretations making the fortune easy to become technically prophetically accurate. This poem follows that style showing that the fate of the suffering individual may be heaven or hell.

### Line-by-line interpretation

| Line                                        | Interpretation 1                                                                                        | Interpretation 2                                                                                                |

| _A putrid pulchritude—a perverse ploy_      | What seemed beautiful once is actually rotten and wicked—it was a trap, part of a plot of the Evil one. | _same as Interpretation 1_                                                                                      |
| _A sanction that cleaves my heart in pain_  | A redemption (sanction) rips (cleaves) my heart, which hurts but is for a good/redemptive cause.        | A punishing force (sanction) holds to (cleaves) my heart, as it were, for the pain I experience.                |
| _A movement, a force, from this evil decoy_ | A powerful, benevolent force moves me away from this evil trap.                                         | A powerful, wicked force works within this evil plot against me.                                                |
| _A grasp holds fast from a numinous plane_  | A grasping hand holds tight (fast) to mine from a heavenly sphere to redeem me from this wicked place.  | An evil hand grasps to hold me still (fast) in this wicked place.                                               |
| _A fleeting hope left fated to destroy_     | The Evil one's hope which was to destroy me is now itself fated to destruction as I am now redeemed.    | My glimmer of hope is put out and fated to die (destroy).                                                       |
| _A sanction cleaves my soul to remain_      | An authorization/power (sanction) holds me together and persuades to stay in a comforting embrace.      | A punishing force breaks my hope and soul and I'm forced to remain in hell.                                     |
| _A pensive pliancy—a pending ploy_          | A dream-like submisseveness allows for a yet-to-be-actualized (pending) heavenly experience.            | A nightmare-like subservience is thrust upon me as part of a yet-to-be-actualized (pending) hellish experience. |
