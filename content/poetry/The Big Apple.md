## Notes

This story dictates a real (or imagined) journey of an Englishman of Yorkshire who falls through a chasm and (loosely referencing an event from the movie, [A Kid in King Aurthur's Court](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113538/)). Upon landing, he finds himself in a strange and foreign land (modern New York). After a couple encounters with individuals exhibiting an indecency typical of New Yorkers, he ends up running from a cop and gets tassed. At this point, he becomes unconscious and floats back to his homeland riding upon a hotdog stand as he partakes of the unfamiliar but much appreciated food.

References connect themes through a large apple, hinting at the nickname of New York, "The Big Apple" (hence the title of the poem), as well as the pig relating to a hotdog (made of pork), mustard seed relating to mustard sauce, and an aroma of bread relating to a hotdog bun. One might reasonably argue that the episode of Lord Archibald was imaginary, but there's enough left open-ended that an alternative interpretation could also be hadâ€”this is by design.
