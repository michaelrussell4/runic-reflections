> The buzz of the bee<br>
> Who makes our honey<br>
> The sizzling sausage<br>
> Eaten by Mr. Gossage<br>
> The bang of a bomb<br>
> To disrupt the calm<br>
> The drip of a drop<br>
> Of rain from up top<br>
> The clang of a cowbell<br>
> Worn by old Marybell<br>
> The popping of popcorn<br>
> All yellow and warm<br>
> The crash of a car<br>
> It bent that bar<br>
> The splash of a seal<br>
> Letting out a squeal<br>
> The thud of a thing<br>
> That's heavy and green<br>
> The gurgling gulp<br>
> Of orange juice with pulp<br>
> The whirring wind<br>
> That makes me bend<br>
> The ding of a doorbell<br>
> It sounds very well
