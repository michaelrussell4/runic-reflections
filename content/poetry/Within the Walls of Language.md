> A mute man strolled along a stream<br>
> When caught his eye a brilliant gleam<br>
> Never a word had this man spoken<br>
> A curse which soon would be broken<br>
><br>
> He dove on down into the blue<br>
> He grasped around without ado<br>
> He held it fast for to acquire<br>
> He held it up: a blue sapphire<br>
><br>
> What a wharf was this<br>
> This pleasant walk of bliss<br>
> Is what this man would shriek<br>
> If he could only speak<br>
><br>
> But as he held the stone<br>
> While he was all alone<br>
> A noise quite like a voice<br>
> Started to rejoice<br>
><br>
> This man was mute no more<br>
> Words from his mouth did pour<br>
> And then to his surprise<br>
> The sapphire grew in size<br>
><br>
> Bigger, bigger, split<br>
> It multiplied a bit<br>
> His wealth it grew and grew<br>
> As well as what he knew<br>
><br>
> For with his language came<br>
> More knowledge to his brain<br>
> He shared it all with others<br>
> His sisters and his brothers
