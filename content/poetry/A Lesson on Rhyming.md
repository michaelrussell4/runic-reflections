> If you wish to rhyme with ease<br>
> Use of rhyme-rich words is key<br>
> Words like "cat", or "dog", or "sky"<br>
> Have many rhymes you can apply<br>
> Words like "orange", "wolf", or "month"<br>
> Will put you in a pickle<br>
> Remember, "light", or "ball", or "tree"<br>
> Will make your task quite easy<br>
> But words like "angel", "pint", or "silver"<br>
> Are poets' Reaper and sickle
