# Notes

Sometimes a terse, mysterious statement can appear wise, prophetic, or remarkable, when it only achieves the illusion of being so due to its vague quality—appearing deep, but really just random nonsense. If you mix certain words and ideas, anything sounds poetic and deep; e.g., "When nebulous thought meets collective action, miracles happen"—if this statement offers anything useful, it is only by accident since it's really a sloppy aggregation of words with no clear meaning. Lack of clarity is the easiest (and laziest) way to appear smart at a low cost.
