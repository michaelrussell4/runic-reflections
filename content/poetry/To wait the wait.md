> If you plant some plants in pots<br>
> And watch your watch while waiting<br>
> You'll tie your hair in knots<br>
> It's terribly frustrating<br>
> <br>
> Instead just dance a dance<br>
> Or fish for fish for fun<br>
> A game of cards perchance<br>
> Or on a slide slide your bum<br>
> <br>
> Watch rain drops drop<br>
> Or drive on a drive<br>
> At a shop you could shop<br>
> Just live your lives<br>
> <br>
> I to my point point clearly<br>
> Which is that plants grow slowly<br>
> When you face vases nearly<br>
> You'll fathom boredom wholly
