> In the night sky, though to me they look small<br>
Giants dance in a majestic ball<br>
They twirl, they whirl, their powers unfurl<br>
In the caliginous they shine like pearls<br>
Some red, some blue, some yellow, some white<br>
Some blink, some glide, but all give off light<br>
Monolithic journey to what is your end<br>
Round in a circle forever you bend<br>
Chaos and order in you both abound<br>
Time favors the latter it makes less sound<br>
Will disentanglement ever resolve<br>
Will your end dissipate and dissolve<br>
Down I sink and my thoughts drown in your depth
