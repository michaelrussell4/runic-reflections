I love a good conspiracy theory, whether it involves shady government coverups or shape-shifting lizard people. What outrageous claims they include! Alas, to my chagrin, they're not all true. Indeed, many are based on bad research, anecdotal evidence, and reaching suppositions.

Perhaps you've heard some of these capitulated by eccentric believers. Their evangelism reeked of paranoia and mental instability. No rational person would believe such things, we tell ourselves. And mainstream intellectuals bolster our doubt and reassure our skepticism, leaving us with smug self-confidence in our position.

However, often folks exercise skepticism prior to investigation, pretending to be scientific while lazily hiding under the protection of their esteemed ethos. Perhaps some claims don't warrant serious study. But don't con yourself into thinking you're the intellectual when all you've done is effortlessly agreed with mainstream thought rather than engaged in any serious research.

I've found that the bedrock of the conspiracy-minded is distrust, sometimes paranoia. Human psychology is poorly equipped to respond to traumatic, paradigm-shattering revelations—leaving many drowning in the waters of psychosis. Once a sensibly constructed view of reality is demolished, then comes the violent waves of paradox, contradiction, and meaninglessness. When the faith of youth is challenged, fidelity of the strong corroded, one thinks, "If I was wrong about that, what else have I been wrong about?" In the psychically weakened state, this morphs into an all-encompassing self-doubt, a crucible of sanity.

From this bedrock of uncertainty, things that used to be impossible become possible. In turn, Nixon's watergate scandal and Operation Northwoods gives precedent for 9/11 being an inside job; Tuskegee syphilis studies make anti-vaccine sentiments sound reasonable; MKUltra and LSD make government corruption and credence for supernaturalism palatable; Big Tobacco's production of fake science, COINTELPRO, assassinations of JFK and MLK, Presidential attendance at Bohemian grove, the list goes on! There's been no shortage of corruption, scandal, and manipulation by institutions we're taught to put our trust in. Government, science, academia, etc., each has committed egregious faults worthy of earning distrust and disgust.

It's no wonder some respond by clinging onto ideas, some of which are verifiably delusional. They've inherently lost trust in institutions and authority. Give them peer-reviewed research, demonstrable logic, and opinions of reputable scientists all you like. It's of no use while their faith has been severed. From this frame of mind, the esotericism claims of charismatic cult leaders is more appealing ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Davidians)). I say this all in attempt to bring us to an understanding of why people believe ideas that others think absurd.

There's another side to this coin—the unwanted truth of the sensational. We're children of the age of reason where the puerile supernaturalism of lore is looked on with scorn. The ancient gods were reduced to wood and stone, the witch turned out to be nothing more than an onery old hag, and the legends of cyclopes were really confabulations of ones who'd never seen elephant skulls ([ref](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-europe/cyclopes-0017369/)). Bit by bit, our magical world was torn down to a clunky old machine. Mysteries turned to banalities and curiosities to boredom.

When coming from this context, not only is it radical to consider things like UFOs and the reality mainstream demonic worship, it's a social liability. It's woven into our DNA to be averse to stigma-inducing behaviors of our society. Despite having intellectual conviction, Galileo's wrestle in disclosing his discoveries was long and difficult.

We ought to maintain humility, keeping in mind that while science has delivered many wonderful successes and theories, it's also had a share of embarrassing moments; e.g., the predicted population bomb of the 60s—turns out we're actually suffering from lack of population in many countries; environmental scientists claiming global cooling and predicting an ice age in the 70s—a virtually opposite claim to what you'd get today; the Ozone hole panic of the 80s—an overstatement, we'd now say; and we don't have space to list the mainstream psychology and medical ideas that have been touted seriously only decades ago but are now refuted with confidence. Political overreach, funding bias, replication problems—science is not sure or concrete.

Don't get me wrong, science is valuable and mistakes are part of the learning journey. It's unreasonable to require a flawless record. I only bring this up to demonstrate aptness of humility here. I've seen enough to know that I don't know.

I'm open to believing many strange and mysterious ideas but I believe few things with confidence, and almost nothing with surety.
