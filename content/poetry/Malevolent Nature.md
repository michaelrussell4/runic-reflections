# Malevolent Nature

> Out I walked on stone terrain<br>
To free my mind from toil<br>
For the sun mine eyes did strain<br>
And on my skin drops boil<br><br>
Near to my foot I cast a gaze<br>
A silk spun to admire<br>
A web, a sea, a deathly maze<br>
To those trapped in its wire<br><br>
Then the devil's mistress crawled<br>
With skin like blackened glass<br>
There she hung with legs out sprawled<br>
With sanguine hourglass<br><br>
A cup filled brim with blood and sin<br>
So time it could not measure<br>
But from it ghostly strings she'd spin<br>
To pique her carnal pleasure<br><br>
Then birthed a curiosity<br>
An idea came to mind<br>
I'd cause a mild atrocity<br>
A show for which I pined<br><br>
I'd catch an unsuspecting prey<br>
To toss into her snare<br>
I'd watch her suck its life away<br>
Then drag it to her lair<br><br>
What a show this sight would be<br>
An unfair fighting match<br>
I set out on a hunting spree<br>
A hopper for to catch<br><br>
Before too long one came along<br>
I stalked and tired it out<br>
I grabbed its legs with fingers strong<br>
Before it jumped about<br><br>
Then I paced o'er to the house<br>
Of malicious majesty<br>
Her thirsty appetite to rouse<br>
Rehearsing tragedy<br><br>
Into her web I flicked the prey<br>
And eagerly I glanced<br>
Out she danced her game to play<br>
A moment and she pranced<br><br>
Concentration fixed and cold<br>
A ritual routine<br>
A corpse in comely silk she rolled<br>
This keen arthropodan queen<br><br>
With delight I watched the sight<br>
Up to the drama's end<br>
The match was made a manic rite<br>
Just as I did intend<br><br>
Then I stood and went my way<br>
Back to my employ<br>
But in my head a voice did say<br>
"You wretched, evil boy"<br><br>
"What pain invoked to entertain"<br>
"A gruesome thing you did"<br>
"To innocense you are a bane"<br>
"Such suffering forbid"<br><br>
I thought on this with troubled mind<br>
But gathered a reply<br>
"Why in me will fault you find"<br>
"Your point I do decry"<br><br>
"For would not pain this spider cause"<br>
"Regardless of my deed?"<br>
"Would not prey fall in her claws"<br>
"An inevitability"<br><br>
"Then if I kill a terminal man"<br>
This voice in me retorted<br>
"Am I guiltless as a lamb?"<br>
Proving my logic distorted<br><br>
"I conceed 'tis evil indeed"<br>
I had to acquiesce<br>
"To alter the fate that God's decreed"<br>
My flaw I did confess<br><br>
"But have you considered" I said<br>
"The mercy of my deed?"<br>
"For while a poor creature is dead"<br>
"Another one I did feed"<br><br>
"Cunning and shrewd thou certainly art"<br>
The voice did wryly say<br>
"Wast mercy indeed in thy heart?"<br>
"In feeding to evil such prey?"<br><br>
Seeing now my guilt did abate<br>
I smiled with mild elation<br>
"Here see you can't discriminate"<br>
"For both are God's creation"<br><br>
While I knew the price I paid<br>
For cheap reward of sport<br>
Would my conscience soon abrade<br>
But reasoned still to thwart<br><br>
My motives were in question still<br>
But nature's laws are just<br>
A higher mind has shown His will<br>
And on us it is thrust<br><br>
I hope within a yearning heart<br>
That mercy is behind<br>
The reasons for such pains so smart<br>
A God with nature kind<br>
