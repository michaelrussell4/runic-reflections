> Poor gal Bella, to be fooled<br>
> Lacks suspicion and gets schooled<br>
> Old Jack's got her by the throat<br>
> He's cunning as the wily goat<br>
> A tampering of reality<br>
> Paranoia, misery<br>
> Jack is really called E.T.<br>
> And Bella she is poor old me<br>
> Victim of a witty devil<br>
> In my insanity he revels<br>
> Truth evasive planting doubt<br>
> Clarity, assurance I'm ever without

## Notes

This poem compares the deeds of Jack to his poor wife, Bella, of Hamilton's play [Gas Light (1938)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_Light) the chicanery of entities deemed extra-terrestrial, and all entities supernatural for that matter, who seem to delight in riding the line between provable existence or non-existance, a form of gaslighting of individuals who feel compelled to believe yet at odds with the matter of proving such existence.
