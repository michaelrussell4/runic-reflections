> What do you do, dear Ella<br>
When it rains do use an umbrella?<br>
Or sing outside acappella?<br>
Like that princess whose name is Elsa<br>
Do you eat crackers with sweet nutella?<br>
Please oh please do tell us<br>
I'll be your very best fella<br>
I love the way you smella<br>
I just wondered if you use an umbrella
