> A tranquil weltanschauung<br>
> A trusting child's luxury<br>
> One can tread that pond<br>
> With blissful ease and levity<br>
> Everything makes sense<br>
> Answers at no expense<br>
> Stroll through the trees<br>
> Frolic through leaves<br>
> Delectable fruit<br>
> Questions are moot<br>
> <br>
> Maturation, heart's ablation<br>
> Entropic flows break it apart<br>
> White is gray and evil smart<br>
> Bedrock is broken, night is dark<br>
> Water is deeper, none can embark<br>
> <br>
> Treading, treading, treading deep<br>
> Can't feel the ground beneath my feet<br>
> Slipping, sliding, where to grasp<br>
> Gasp for air, I drown and sink<br>
> Searching mind, ever I think<br>
> <br>
> Roiling waters in which I tread<br>
> Seem to wish that I were dead<br>
> Irritated, troubled they<br>
> Same within my soul, today<br>
> I'm in myself, a troubled doom<br>
> How did I grow into this tomb?

# Note

Peter Pan wanted to stay a child forever in his adventurous, blissful paradise. Another Pan—quite an eponymous archetype—has produced the epitome of this poem's digression.

A child's ways are simple and pure. Everything is black and white and makes sense. Growing into adulthood often involves challenging these simple, foundational premises of one's world view. This dissonance is uncomfortable, likened to treading bottomless waters. Some find some sandbank on which to touch their toes, be they religious frameworks or ideologies. These placate many to search no longer. For others, they turn out to be fish and sea monsters instead of sandbanks or footings. For such, the miserable treading continues.
