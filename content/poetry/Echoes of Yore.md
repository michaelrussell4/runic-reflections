> I hear a song<br>
> A **peaceful piece**<br>
> **Full** of long<br>
> Notes not to cease<br>
> <br>
> I see a sight<br>
> A **maiden made**<br>
> **In** lovely light<br>
> Her prayer she gave<br>
> <br>
> I rode a steed<br>
> A great **knight's mare**<br>
> Quick to her need<br>
> From ill **nightmare**<br>

## Notes

👸⚔️🐎🎵

This poem contains three homophonic pairs: "peaceful, piece full", "maiden, made in", and "knight's mare, nightmare". The rest is just artistic creativity to incorporate them together.
