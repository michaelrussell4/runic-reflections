> My reflection in darkness beckons my entrance<br>
With shimmering pieces of mystery there<br>
Far and unknown myself I am<br>
My relationships tie to veiled places<br>
Are they hidden or are they forgotten?<br>
Is knowledge lost or intentionally hid?<br>
Alas, all is vanity, vanity, vanity, I pity.
