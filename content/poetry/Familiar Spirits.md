> Again I find myself within<br>
> Edifice of the ghoul and djinn<br>
> Strange fantasms, traps and chasms<br>
> Doleful creatures, ectoplasms<br>
> Furtively, I hide and flee<br>
> Futilely, we all agree<br>
> No fear but curiosity<br>
> Odd: my phobic callosity<br>
> A familiar clairvoyance<br>
> A slight annoyance<br>
> I've been there so often<br>
> Perhaps it's my coffin

## Notes

Based on a strange dream I must have had at least 10 times in my lifeâ€”I'm in a haunted house. I explore the strange paranormal phenomena and I usually hide and run from some of the evil forces. The odd thing is that I don't recall ever feeling scared.
