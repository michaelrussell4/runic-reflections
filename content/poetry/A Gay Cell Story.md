## Notes

Though the name sounds like it could refer to a prison nightmare, it's actually an innocuous reference to a homophone (gay=homo, cell=phone) story. This poem tells a story that can have two meanings if using different words for the homophones. The left-hand side labeled "Rural" tells a story of a hare, or a rabit that breaks through thyme plants to escape the prospect of becoming meat for a predator, a failed attempt, though. The predator smells his scent and tears in pieces for a feast. The right-hand side tells a story that could be a business person who drives in traffic and brakes to avoid an unwanted meeting, or accident, again, a failed attempt. Because of their fender-bender they pay a pretty cent (money) to someone who takes it home to their suite. This man writes a note for peace owing to the money paid him. The business-person, now stressed with messy hair, eats lunch in hastely and stressed fashion.
