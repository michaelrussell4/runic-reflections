Summary: Learn more about the purpose and inspiration behind Runic Relics, a collection of poetry exploring spiritual, philosophical, and linguistic creativity.

## Welcome to [Runic Relics](/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Mike** and this is a digital collection of my poetry. My reasons for writing poetry vary. Sometimes it's to express a complex theme or philosophical dilemma, other times it's to use some new words I've learned to help them stick in my memory. Some of my poems are mysterious or dark while others are comical or silly. I hope that by making them accessible I can share these thoughts in the unique form of poetry for appreciation and enjoyment.

You'll find that this site includes an index for all poems as well as a search bar. Poems have also been categorized with tags. Note that these tags were generated by AI and, consequently, may not agree with my personal preference. In time I may correct some of them. But I hope they can serve some utility despite their possible misapplication.

## How the Site Works

I built **Runic Relics** using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator that converts simple Markdown files into a polished website. Every poem I write begins as a Markdown file, allowing me to focus on the words themselves. A simple `git push` brings new creations to life on the site. Professionally, I write code, so building this website was a fun task that combined my skills and interests.

Thank you for visiting Runic Relics. I hope these poems inspire thought, spark curiosity, or simply bring a smile. Feel free to explore, reflect, and enjoy this evolving collection of verses.
