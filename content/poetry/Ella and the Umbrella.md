> What do you do, dear Ella<br>
> When it rains do use an umbrella?<br>
> Or sing outside acappella?<br>
> Like that princess whose name is Elsa<br>
> Do you eat crackers with sweet nutella?<br>
> Please oh please do tell us<br>
> I'll be your very best fella<br>
> I love the way you smella<br>
> I just wondered if you use an umbrella
