Is God to blame? It depends. If God created everything from scratch with complete foreknowledge and control, there are virtually no others to blame. God would be the author whose pen unmistakably wrote out each part and event.

> God creates from scratch with foreknowledge, predestining our fate **→** Our fate is determined by God, not us **→** God, not us, is to blame.

Why a benevolent being would predestine anyone to eternal suffering is perplexing. Adherents to this philosophy claim that because he is sovereign, it is his prerogative. Say this if you like, but it does nothing to resolve the moral dilemma. Although it could be his right to exert this influence upon some, fating them to evil, it is morally abhorrent. Some resist this dissonance, shifting their focus to the enjoyment of their precious salvation. Gratefully, they were lucky enough to have been allotted such, they think.

Others view the fate of those unfortunate souls with discomfort—enough to suggest that this fate is necessary—yet they deprive God of power in their explanations, making him beholden to hypothetical boundaries or laws. Or they argue that we are not in a position to evaluate God's justice. This raises the question: why would God create us in such a way that his behavior appears morally detestable to us? Another, more lethal, blow to this argument is what God says of Adam following his partaking of the forbidden fruit:

> Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.
> — *Genesis 3:22*

Can we not then judge between good and evil?

This leads to the crux of monergism: it is morally indigestible. Not an antinomy, but a contradiction, lies at its core. The moral incongruence of this theology challenges the heart of the Christian ethos. The issue stems from our definition of God and his creation. Are we certain about every component of that? Perhaps he is not benevolent—no, too disagreeable. Perhaps he hadn’t foreknowledge—a slippery slope. Perhaps he did not create from nothing—could this be?

Some think it heretical or deeply challenging: a substance coeternal, coexistent with God. But suppose we allow for such a substance or agent, distinct from God, which becomes part of the soul he sires. By doing so, we shift some measure of responsibility away from God and attribute it to these self-directing agents. Enabled by God but not determined by him, these agents act independently, even as God’s influence remains pervasive.

Entertaining this possibility may give rise to challenging questions:
If stuff exists coeternally with God, can he be called the Creator in the absolute sense? Does this limit his power or sovereignty? If God did not create this stuff, does it exert influence beyond his control? While these are good questions, and while I feel they have satisfying answers, it's beyond this essay's reach to address them all.

Whether these are mysterious intelligences existing from eternity or, perhaps, literal emanations of God himself, we cannot say with certainty. Functioning as “random seeds” in the algorithm of souls, these agents break the chain of absolute determinism. In this way, they provide a conceptual bridge—an explanatory lemma—that allows for the compatibility of free will, moral justice, and the benevolent character traditionally ascribed to God.

Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hinted at this mysterious yet compelling doctrine:

> Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.
> — *D&C 93:29*

Later, he expounded on this in a discourse that became known as the *King Follett Sermon*:

> I am dwelling on the immortality of the spirit of man. Is it logical to say that the intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it has a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal [co-eternal] with our Father in heaven.
> …
> The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits.

This doctrine challenges the traditional Christian notion that God is the only uncreated being and that all else was created from nothing. However, it also offers a solution to the problems of this traditional view, such as the issue of God being the responsible originator of suffering, evil, and predestined damnation. Before rejecting this new teaching merely for its disagreement with long-held traditions, it is worth evaluating the source of such traditions. Does the Bible explicitly say God created everything from nothing? Some would say so:

> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
> — *(John 1:3)*

However, if we parse this verse carefully, it becomes less clear. Whether "all things" refers to all material things, all created things, or all ontological categories of things is uncertain. Would it encompass abstract concepts—love, hate, 2+2=4? Would it include the Holy Ghost, the Son? Either this verse refers only to contingent, created objects, or, if we assume the all-encompassing interpretation strictly, even God himself would be created by himself. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Either "all things" excludes uncreated entities, or it paradoxically encompasses even God himself. It turns out this verse is not as clear as a first glance may indicate.

Personally, I find it questionable when we treat scriptures like mathematical axioms of perfection that would not be modified by their authors upon interrogation. Regardless, I claim that upon close inspection of any worthy source for support, we find ourselves unsure whether this dogma of *creation ex nihilo* can hold as necessarily true. If there exists a compatible alternative, the coeternal agent model deserves serious consideration.
