## Notes

ðŸ˜©ðŸ–¤

Written on 4/29/2024. I've been attempting to incorporate some archaic Middle-English into some of my poems, though probably incorrectly. I suppose many of my poems, like this one, have a somber and dramatic tone. They don't accurately depict the whole of my feelingâ€”usually I'm in pretty good spirits. But deep pain, saddness, struggle, etc. make for good poetry. ðŸ˜‰

This poem describes the weary times when willpower is overcome by fatigue and contrary to our better judgement we engage in petty habits or vices that do us no good, or even sometimes harm. This morning I feel weary and am tempted to succumb to such vices but with prayer and reaching out to friends I'm usually able to reconnect with reality and God's hope.
