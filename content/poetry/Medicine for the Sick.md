Bless me, Father
I'm poisoned, infected
Dress me in wrappings
My soul I've neglected

A man of grief is sent my way
On us shines your hopeful ray
A stranger confides
Tears fill his eyes
In me your spirit doth sway

My cup is filled
Good providence
Parasites killed
New confidence

At thy brilliance I'm awed
Thank you, God
