> An evil force infecting darkness<br>
> Stealing realms, their souls to harness<br>
> Six had fallen, greed to allay<br>
> Before their fall, the seventh did pray<br>
> <br>
> Across the stars their pleas did fly<br>
> Seeking salvation from what was nigh<br>
> Oruto heard and woke her son<br>
> The hero's child, the chosen one<br>
> <br>
> He beckoned saying 'Here I am'<br>
> And shot forth to a floral land<br>
> Over foes his strength did rise<br>
> He spun and sped up through the skies<br>
> <br>
> Each of the monsters he defeated<br>
> Releasing souls which were secreted<br>
> The rulers rose back to their thrones<br>
> And citizens back to their homes<br>
> <br>
> Flower, water, fire, euphony<br>
> Icy cold and machinery<br>
> Victory over all these came<br>
> Then a labyrinthâ€”a mental game<br>
> <br>
> The greedy lord he fought with might<br>
> An awful battle, a terrible sight<br>
> He conquered over that evil power<br>
> And joyful cheers on him did shower<br>
> <br>
> They praised the star, the shining light<br>
> His risen state, their mighty knight<br>
> Father, mother, by his side<br>
> With them he would now abide
