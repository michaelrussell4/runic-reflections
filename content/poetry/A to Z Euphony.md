## Notes

ðŸ˜« Phew! That was quite an exercise. It's not the most cohesive or syntactically robust poem I've written but it meets the criterion of having each successive word begin with the letters of the alphabet in order. This constraint made it difficult to convey a coherent idea but what was attempted here was reflexiveâ€”the poem is about itself. It is a brusque circumlocation jotted down with components of poetic form presented with, hopefully, resplendence.
