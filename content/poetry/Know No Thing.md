> Do you know a thing?<br>
> I thought I did but didn't<br>
> What a mental fling<br>
> Arrogance intermittent<br><br>
> When your mind is tall<br>
> And confidence is stout<br>
> Painful is your fall<br>
> Your stench will reak of doubt<br><br>
> I'd rather claim a lacking<br>
> And chance to cut me short<br>
> No reason to be bragging<br>
> My ego to contort
