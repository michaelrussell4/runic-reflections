> Thy mysteries are great 'tis true<br>
> My heart it pines I never knew<br>
> I never learned, I suffered long<br>
> An ignorant path my feet are on<br>
> But still I walked in shadowy mist<br>
> Yearning, searching, never I wist<br>
> Who keeps me from that glorious light<br>
> And have me tread in darkened night<br>
> In somber song I move along<br>
> In this charade the fool I play<br>
> I pray these doubts be answered nay<br>
> So raise the curtain of Thy face<br>
> Fill my void, Thy Eternal Grace
