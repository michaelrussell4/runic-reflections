> Poor Callisto, you're stuck in a rut<br>
> Strewn in the sky with a cup for a butt<br>
> Once beheld as a beautiful sight<br>
> Now you're an ursine beast of the night<br>
> Lustful eyes cloaked with disguise<br>
> Jupiter's deeds were your demise<br>
> Once your fairness love brought forth<br>
> Now wayfarers your rump guides north<br>
> Whether by gods or man or cow<br>
> You were looked on then and still are now
