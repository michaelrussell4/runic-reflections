> Sir, can you not help me?<br>
&emsp;It depends on what you mean<br>
Of course, you do not have to<br>
&emsp;Your intentions are not keen<br>
I won't say I don't want your help<br>
&emsp;Whatever is your plea?<br>
Now I see that I'm a bother<br>
&emsp;In this I must agree<br>
Well perhaps I might just ask<br>
&emsp;Please do it if you must<br>
Will you, won't you, can't you, sir<br>
&emsp;You're earning my disgust<br>
Oh nevermind, the time has past<br>
&emsp;At this I'm quite relieved<br>
Oh good, I'm glad; you are not mad<br>
&emsp;Quite a turnaround you've achieved
