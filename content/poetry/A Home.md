A<br>
house<br>
Is not a home<br>
A place merely to roam<br>
A home is more pleasant and good<br>
The difference between them lies deeper than wood<br>
A house is a shelter a covering overhead<br>
A house is a place having pillow and bed<br>
A home is a fortress from what is profane<br>
A home it has warmth and love to sustain<br>
A house will protect you enough to get by<br>
A home is a foundation to flourish and fly
