> Fingerprints found but are mistaken for tarnish<br>
Great works abound but evade capturing harness<br>
All else but be known these do for his cause<br>
Only for the crown all obey his laws<br>
Hidden behind clouds his light doth shine<br>
Bidden to stay lest man's mind doth find<br>
Be it our place to hunger and thirst<br>
Longing unanswered this is our curse<br>
But for this confusion and impossible quest<br>
His goodness displayed and existence manifest
