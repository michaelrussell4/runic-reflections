# Notes

A story told via emojis. It's about boy reading a book, realizes he's late for something, runs, crashes into a girl. They meet and greet. Then a zombie apocalypse occurs and they dash away for their lives only to have to resort to defense by arson. The zombies die. The world starts over. And they start a family together😃
