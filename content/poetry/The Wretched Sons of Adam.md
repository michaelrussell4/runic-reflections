Title: The Wretched Sons Of Adam

A wild man born into tribulation
Works his life to improve his station
He feeds his needs with strength of hand
Hunting beasts with a chosen band

His son improves a shelter secure
His gains are found with rope and lure
A family protected, a future perceived
Tomorrow exists; thought is acheived

Wealth is gained by domestication
Growth ensues on a furtile foundation
Children are reared and carefully taught
Money's invented and merchandise bought

"Perhaps", thinks man exercising his brain
"We could elude hunger, toils, and pain"
This thought led to action
And soon it gained traction

Year after year inventions were made
Wells issued water with bucket and braid
Beasts of burden plowed the field
Smiths forged tools for man to wield

But an odd thing happened with each improvement
These tools for man did not still his movement
He hadn't more rest nor absense of worry
Always in a hurry his thoughts in a scurry

Even more to add to this
His learning threatened to steal his bliss
For as man slowly tamed his brawn
His mind would reason from dusk to dawn

"Why do we workâ€”why do we play?"
"All is vanity at the end of day."
"What I took as a child magic to be"
"Seems more so now like machinery."

As man's burdens were lightened
All the more his mind frightened
His soul wore new manacle
His heart grew mechanical

With softened skin and hardened soul
Dead eyes that none could console
He'd watch with pain
The children playing

"Oh how they frolic" said he
"Those young, poor fools cannot see"
"If they only knew how empty life was"
"Then they might give their play pause"

He snidely snarked in smug misery
As the children laughed and played with glee
That day the man died a poor genius
As the children explored rocks on venus

The children grew up and matured
But their reality was blurred
Figments of their former fantasy
Revived with life to threaten their sanity

Against better knowledge they saw
Supernatural sightings forced rueful awe
Doubt vied reason wreaking terrible treason
What uncertain times came with this new season

War and sickness truth and lie
Questions were asked wondering why
Wrestling souls fraught with dissonance
Angst of curiousity makes a mighty impetus

Poor creatures changed their outside
But a poison festered inside
Though work and toil were almost gone
Their misery lived on and on

Such is the state of those who are dead
No solace no answers only dread
It's not the body nor mind of course
But a heart disconnected from its life Source

## Notes

This poem chronicles man's efforts to save himself from his own misery. He thinks that removing his burdens and pains will soothe his psyche but, alas, his God-hunger lives on. He cannot be complete without his Connection and Life. See hints to different ages of man: stone, byzantine, industrial, etc.
