A goatherd lived on a hill near a village. His wife bore him a son. When the boy was ten years old, his father put him in charge of taking the goats to graze in the upper hills. Each day, the boy would walk five miles to the greener patches of hillside where the goats could graze all day. He would wait under the shade of trees or play with sticks and rocks. Sometimes, he pretended the sticks were animals or people and played pretend with them.

One day, the goats scattered in fear. The boy investigated and found that a large snake had slithered among them. He grabbed a stick and was about to kill the snake when it said, "You look like a very smart boy; perhaps you can help me solve a problem." The boy was curious and replied, "I'm smart enough. What's your problem?" The snake responded, "I have something stuck in my throat, and since I have no arms, I can't get it out. You can look inside and grab whatever it is for me. In return, I'll promise not to bother your goats anymore." The boy considered this a fair trade. He replied, "Alright. I'll help you by grabbing the thing out of your throat, and you won't bother my goats."

The snake opened its mouth wide. The boy looked inside and said, "I don't see anything." The snake replied, "Look back farther." The boy put his head deeper into the snake's mouth but still could not see anything. The snake insisted it was even farther back. Soon enough, the boy had crawled into the snake's mouth, and the snake swallowed him whole‚Äîstick and all. The fat snake licked its lips and slowly slithered onto a rock in the sun to take a nap. The boy shouted and kicked, but to no avail. The snake's tough skin held him fast. As the snake began to snooze, the goats continued grazing on the grass.

Sitting in the dark belly of the snake, the boy thought about how to escape when he came up with an idea. "Got it!" he shouted. "What's that?" the snake asked, awakened by the boy's shouts. The boy replied, "I found the thing that was stuck in your throat!" The snake was confused, as he thought nothing had been stuck in his throat. He responded, "Silly boy. There was never anything in my throat. I only said that to trick you into climbing into my mouth." The boy countered, "But I did find something in here. It's good that I found it, for if I hadn't, you'd soon be dead. It's really quite an awful thing."

The snake began to worry, wondering what awful thing was in his throat. He asked, "What is it? Tell me now." The boy said, "It took me a while to find it because it's dark in here and it was really far back. But sure enough, I found a sticky-doo." The snake asked, "What is a sticky-doo? I've never heard of such a thing." The boy explained, "A sticky-doo is the most fearsome of creatures that lives here in these hills." The snake contested, "I've never seen one. Are you sure about this?" "Oh yes, quite sure," the boy replied. "Sticky-doos live all over these hills. Usually, they hold still, not moving. But at certain times, they'll spring up, stabbing, whacking, and flying through the air."

The snake was surprised to hear this and began to feel uneasy. "Please, pull the sticky-doo out right away." The boy agreed, "Open your mouth, and I'll climb out. I'm holding the sticky-doo. It won't hurt you as long as I prevent it." The snake opened wide. The boy saw the sunlight streaming in through the snake's mouth and was relieved to see and breathe fresh air again. He climbed his way out of the snake, but as he emerged, he wedged his stick between the snake's jaws. The snake's mouth was stuck wide open.

The boy exclaimed, "Oh no, it looks like the sticky-doo is attacking!" Terrified, the snake slithered away as fast as lightning, with the stick still lodged between its jaws. While the boy never saw that snake again, he learned that you never trust a snake.
