> The captive pig may live in peace<br>
As bliss and gluttony increase<br>
Until his master marks his fate<br>
Better not to anticipate<br>
The pig's dull mind is unaware<br>
Of anxiety this him does spare<br>
But cursed man with cunning fear<br>
Must face his fate and see it clear<br>
He knows he'll die, he wonders why<br>
He might embrace it or deny<br>
Some fools seek to live like swine<br>
Fleeing fears with pleasure divine<br>
With facts of fate they cannot err<br>
Death comes nearer with his stare
