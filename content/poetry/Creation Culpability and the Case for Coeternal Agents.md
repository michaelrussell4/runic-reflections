Is God to blame? It depends. If God created everything from scratch with complete foreknowledge and control, there are virtually no others to blame. God would be the author whose pen unmistakably wrote out each part and event.

> God creates from scratch with foreknowledge, predestining our fate **→** Our fate is determined by God, not us **→** God, not us, is to blame.

Why a benevolent being would predestine anyone to eternal suffering is perplexing. Adherents claim that because he is sovereign, it is his prerogative. Say this if you like, but it does not resolve the moral dilemma. It could be his right to fate some to evil, though morally, this is disagreeable. Some resist this dissonance, shifting their focus to the enjoyment of their precious salvation. They were lucky enough to have been allotted such.

Others view the fate of those unfortunate souls with discomfort and suggest that this fate might be necessary. Yet, they deprive God of power in their explanations, making him beholden to hypothetical boundaries or laws. Another alternative, more popular alternative, is to argue that we are not in a position to evaluate God's justice. This raises the question why God created us in such a way as to find his ways morally distasteful. Additionally, does not God say we have the capacity to know good from evil?

> Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.
> — *Genesis 3:22*

This leads to the crux of monergism: it is morally indigestible. The moral incongruence of this theology challenges the heart of the Christian ethos. We can trace the issue down to the root: the definition of God and his creation. Are we certain about every component of this definition? Perhaps he is not benevolent—no, too disagreeable. Perhaps he hadn’t foreknowledge—scriptures are quite clear against this. Perhaps he did not create from nothing—could this be?

The idea that God created ex materia ("from matter") was held or entertained by a few early Christians (Origen of Alexandria, Irenaeus of Lyons, Athenagoras); however, *creatio ex nihilo* ("creation from nothing") is the prevailing view. The greeks had been debating this subject for centuries before Christianity. Their conclusion: "Nothing comes from nothing" (Parmenides, Plato, Lucretius). They favored *creatio ex deo* ("creation from God") via something like pandeism or panentheism. But while the Greeks had influence upon Christian theology, one is not the other. As for Christianity, is it a compatible option to opt out of *creation ex nihilo*? Doing so might be the solution to what many consider the weakest point of Christian theology. Consider how the problem of evil, suffering, and predestined damnation stem from this stance—God is the sole originator. Seeing this, it is worth examining whether an alternative is truly incompatible with the Bible or not. 

So, does the Bible explicitly say God created everything from nothing?

Genesis 1: We enter our familiar six-day creation story with this context: "the earth was without form, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the deep." Then comes day one: God creates light. Darkness is mentioned to exist though its inception is not explicitly attributed to God. Day two: God creates a firmament in the midst of waters—wait, what waters? Did those exist before the days of creation? As the story ensues, a careful reader will notice that the creation story appears to emerge from a context of existing chaotic matter.

This swirling chaotic water or void is actually a typical motif in creation stories including those from the Mesopatamian, Egyptian, Hindu, and Norse cultures. The biblical story seems to share this presupposition, instead of nothingness, we get a formless earth and chaotic waters.

If our creation account can't decide the matter for us, a concerning realization, perhaps the New Testament can.

> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
> — *(John 1:3)*

At first glance, this appears to favor *creatio ex nihilo*. However, if we parse this verse carefully, it becomes less clear. Whether "all things" refers to all material things, all created things, or all ontological categories of things is uncertain. Would it encompass abstract concepts such as love, hate, 2+2=4? Would it include the Holy Ghost? Either this verse refers only to contingent objects or, if we assume the all-encompassing interpretation, even God himself would be created by himself. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Either "all things" excludes uncreated entities, or it paradoxically encompasses even God himself. At very least, we warrant some fuzziness as to the precise meaning of this verse. ([**Does John 1:3 rule out uncreated abstract objects?**](https://www.rightreason.org/2011/does-john-13-rule-out-uncreated-abstract-objects/))

Personally, I find it questionable when we treat scriptures as mathematical axioms of perfection that would not be modified by their authors upon information and interrogation. Regardless, I claim that upon close inspection of any worthy source for support, we find ourselves without definitive support for the dogma of *creation ex nihilo*. Hopefully, this will lower any objections that prevent us from at least considering our alternative.

Having provided room for this alternative, let us consider a substance coeternal, coexistent with God, which becomes part of the soul he sires. By doing so, we shift some measure of responsibility away from God and attribute it to these self-directing agents. Enabled by God but not determined by him, these agents act independently, even as God’s influence remains pervasive.

Entertaining this possibility may give rise to challenging questions:
If stuff exists coeternally with God, can he be called the Creator in the absolute sense? If God did not create it, does it exert influence beyond his control? Is this panantheism. While these are good questions, and while I feel there are answers, it's beyond this essay's reach to address them all here.

Whether these are mysterious intelligences existing from eternity or, perhaps, literal emanations of God himself, we cannot say with certainty. Functioning as “random seeds” in the algorithm of souls, these agents break the chain of absolute determinism. In this way, they provide a conceptual bridge—an explanatory lemma—that allows for the compatibility of free will, moral justice, and the benevolent character traditionally ascribed to God.

Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hinted at this mysterious yet compelling doctrine:

> Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.
> — *D&C 93:29*

Later, he expounded on this in a discourse that became known as the *King Follett Sermon*:

> I am dwelling on the immortality of the spirit of man. Is it logical to say that the intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it has a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal [co-eternal] with our Father in heaven.
> …
> The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with Himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits.

The benefits afforded by this coeternal agent model are remarkable. This would be a game-changer in Christian theology, aiding in defending itself against some of the most compelling criticisms. While this alternative seems radical and lacks popularity, I hope I've demonstrated it deserves serious consideration.
