> Mournful mary<br>
Lived in melancholy<br>
Others would ask<br>
Why she was aghast<br>
She'd answer them sorrowfully<br>
<br>
How some years prior<br>
There'd been a fire<br>
And in it her doll<br>
Thrown in by Paul<br>
An evil, wretched squire<br>
<br>
"So", she explained<br>
"My heart is stained"<br>
Weeping in agony<br>
Telling this tragedy<br>
'til she was old and drained<br>
<br>
Years passed by<br>
Mary cried<br>
<br>
Then came a man<br>
With something in hand<br>
It was her doll<br>
The manâ€”old Paul<br>
"You left it out in the sand"<br>
<br>
"Oh me, oh my!"<br>
Was Mary's reply<br>
"I thought she was burned"<br>
"My joy you spurned!"<br>
"How dare you be so wry"<br>
<br>
"I threw in a ball"<br>
"Not your old doll"<br>
Paul remonstrated<br>
Mary's tears abated<br>
"Days later I found this doll"<br>
<br>
Mary's eyes grew wide<br>
Her heart filled with pride<br>
But she let out a sigh<br>
All this saddness rife<br>
On a mistaken lie<br>
<br>
The doll was unharmed<br>
Her sorrow disarmed<br>
But the years she had lost<br>
Were a tragic cost<br>
A life in sadness consumed<br>
