> Language embedded with information<br>
Patterns of deliberate persuasion<br>
Any who speak betray their mind<br>
Numbers and data—good or maligned<br>
Sound in the ether, fire in the night<br>
When God spoke his Word was Light

# Notes

Very cryptic, I admit. This speaks of the idea that language contains the beliefs and values of a society; therefore, it is embedded with that information. When one speaks, he reveals his thoughts—more than what is merely explicitely stated. This principle allows Large-Language Models (LLMs) to function. On the basis of linguistic patterns that delienate what we deam true and false, they work. Similar to this principle of the spoken word (language), light extends into darkness and introduces truth. Light is truth. It carries the vision of reality wherever it travels. Where it does not travel, there is nothing—null, void. Without light, there is nothing.
