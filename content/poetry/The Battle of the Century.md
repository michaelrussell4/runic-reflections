> A threat was made, retreat, survive<br>

> In wrath I marched on unprotected<br>
> Joined by my comrade knight<br>

> Though at first I doubted<br>
> His enemies he did soon devour<br>

> At last his victory was made sure<br>
> My Lord knows all, his wisdom great<br>
> His power unmatched, his intentions pure
