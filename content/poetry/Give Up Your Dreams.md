"Follow your dreams": a banal trope dressed up over and again, presented as the essential path to happiness. In The Alchemist (Coelho), this theme is depicted via fantasy-adventure, in The Secret (Byrne), it's delivered as an esoteric, new-age novelty, really a get-anything-you-want-quick scheme.

How simple the words make it sound and how appealing the results appear. And after the wanton excitement of these sensationalized messages fade for such sincerely attempting disciples, how many of them reach the ascendant pinnacle of wellbeing? Are they not a deliriously optimistic congregation grasping for an idyllic panacea, investing more time and money than most of them might ever reclaim?

"But isn't there a certain je ne sais quoi about the debonair salesman" they think, "yes, and a poetic lure to the blithe vagaries of the new-aged esoteric?" What soporifics they use to pacify against the bitter reality they face. Some even appear to succeed in convincing themselves to believe such vanities—what great proselytes these make. All this attests more of the adherents than the efficacy of such movements; we humans are a miserable bunch eager to make allowances to pave the way for anything to make sense of or deliver us from our pain. And these platitudes offer just that. So, they become our golden calf.

Man thinks he knows what he wants, what will make him happy. He usually knows little more than a child in this regard. Fixated on local pleasures, he engages in hedonistic behaviors like the child who consumes sweets ad nauseam, having not sense nor restraint. Thus, he assumes a proportionate weight of regret and suffering.

In demonstration of this we may consider the case of numerous lottery winners who instantaneously acquire more wealth than they can responsibly handle and soon find themselves in financial, personal, and emotional ruin. What went awry? Were they not given the power to pursue their dreams and follow their heart? How foolish man was to claim such platitudes. To what destination will such a fickle and carnal heart drive?

One might justifiably argue this to be an exceptional case, a straw-man. It's true, many have more sense than such individuals having developed skills of responsible management of at least their finances. But where they have not such refinement, they will partake in excess to their detriment such as with licentiousness or gluttony. Examine the personal, reckless lives of those who've had riches and fame thrust upon them. You'll find their internal wellbeing is worse off than the average chap.

But all these aside, let's take the ideal individual who has been reared carefully and learned the basic lessons of living. He may realize the limitations of money, substance, and pleasure in serving his wellbeing. Such an one approaches the problem of his distresses not through commercial or substance indulgence.

Instead, he looks to alternative revenues of allegedly meaningful purpose touted and preached in cinema and print: pursue a career, get a pet, become engaged in social issues. How many movies portray this motif, crafting narratives that implement these each in such an unrealistic form so as to be laughable. But these are mere distractions for existential angst that only temporarily lull and placate the mind that longs for the real thing.

But these substitutes are superior in that they address not the temporary but the long-term situation offering a sense of need and belonging in exchange for persistent commitment. They seek to find meaning to wrest that angst rather than temporary sedatives to numb and high. They're getting at it but not quite there, always falling something short of the mark.

Then comes the new era of self-help advertising the hidden secret of happiness—be your true self, follow your dreams, be you; a masturbatory ideology and ego-centric pacifier for individuals who are so squalidly disconnected with themselves and empty of personality that such an endeavor obfuscates its own end.

Nevertheless, they preach this new doctrine as they strain to pretend it works. With little resistance, it's proliferated and endemic to our society. It's in our movies, our stories, the lives of our pop culture idols as the summum bonum of human existence.

Howbeit, those of simple and humble birth appear more content and human than such aristocrats spoiled by modern inventions and thought. They cannot see that it's in self-sacrifice, not self-service, that we are filled, in giving that we receive. The simple and humble matters of life such as building a family, serving God, and caring for your fellow man are where we ultimately find meaning and purpose.

Beware of self-will, the root of all our troubles. The world cannot understand this saying.
