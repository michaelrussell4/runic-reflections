# Seasonal Cycles

> Spring into being blossoming buds<br>
A green scene of life without strife<br>
What was sown is now grown<br>
To the oxygen gas leaves cleave fast<br>
The garden bombarded bleating in heat<br>
Burned by the power of what it must devour<br>
Withering and dithering but pressing on<br>
A splash of relief ocassionally lulls grief<br>
Cool wind bends their stalwart stalks<br>
A harvest steals and spreads their seeds<br>
Smell of cider, spice, and frost<br>
Strength wanes old but it runs deep<br>
The warblers have departed a new path charted<br>
An old man lays down in his white gown
