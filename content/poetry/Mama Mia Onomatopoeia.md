# Mama Mia Onomatopoeia

> The buzz of the bee<br>
Who makes our honey<br>
The sizzling sausage<br>
Eaten by Mr. Gossage<br>
The bang of a bomb<br>
To distrupt the calm<br>
The drip of a drop<br>
Of rain from up top<br>
The clang of a cowbell<br>
Worn by old Marybell<br>
The popping of popcorn<br>
All yellow and warm<br>
The crash of a car<br>
It bent that bar<br>
The splash of a seal<br>
Letting out a squeal<br>
The thud of a thing<br>
That's heavy and green<br>
The gurgling gulp<br>
Of orange juice with pulp<br>
The whirring wind<br>
That makes me bend<br>
The ding of a doorbell<br>
It sounds very well
