> With mi amigo Ego I tango<br>
> A clingy thing he won't let go<br>
> His weight I carry with strain<br>
> His sustenance is my pain<br>
> I used to think us great friends<br>
> But knew not to what awful ends<br>
> Our companionship costs me loads<br>
> My slow death his hunger forbodes<br>
> So I'm seeking to lose my Ego<br>
> To find a new Friend. Here we go

## Notes

### Matthew 10:39

> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
