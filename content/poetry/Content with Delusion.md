> My house was built upon a stone<br>
> A firm foundation for a home<br>
> It survived the wind and rain<br>
> It's very strong, I can't complain<br>
> <br>
> But one day, as I walked about<br>
> I had concern which led to doubt<br>
> I saw that what I thought was stone<br>
> Was an elephant's skull—a giant bone<br>
> <br>
> I fretted as I wondered how<br>
> I'd missed this giant head of a cow<br>
> I worried standing on the floor<br>
> Could I live here anymore?<br>
> <br>
> On the other hand, I thought<br>
> Maybe I shouldn't be distraught<br>
> After all, it's held up well<br>
> Maybe I could still here dwell<br>
> <br>
> So in my house I stayed that night<br>
> When in my bed I dreamed in fright<br>
> An elephant all big and mean<br>
> Seemed to want to say something<br>
> <br>
> She marched up near, over my bed<br>
> She came up close, head to head<br>
> She lifted me upon her back<br>
> Then outside she started to walk<br>
> <br>
> She journeyed up a mountain tall<br>
> I sat there riding, feeling small<br>
> We arrived soon at the top<br>
> And on the ground she set me—plop<br>
> <br>
> A giant stone was standing there<br>
> The elephant looked with a stare<br>
> Then she walked over to it<br>
> Lowered her head and ploughed right through it<br>
> <br>
> In surprise I then confessed<br>
> "Your head is harder than I guessed!"<br>
> The elephant seemed pleased at this<br>
> And with her trunk gave me a kiss<br>
> <br>
> She lifted me upon her head<br>
> And took me down back to my bed<br>
> Beneath my house this elephant lay<br>
> She had chased my doubts away<br>
> <br>
> After this, I had confidence<br>
> My life went on in providence<br>
> I don't suppose it makes much sense<br>
> But does anything in life?

# Notes

This allegory could be related to one who's paradigm or framework of faith and living becomes unstable. In such a circumstance, unease and doubt are quite prevalent. Perhaps the rigid framework we'd previously held cannot account for the facts we face. 

In this case, we might loosen our rules to permit what appear to be contradictions in return for sanity and peace of mind. By so doing, we might consider ourselves as either fools or sages, coming to terms with a reality whose truths are beyond our grasp. 

For example, the final line breaks the scheme and order of the entire poem. You might be bothered by this, as you would by the elephant you've built your house on. Or you might not.
