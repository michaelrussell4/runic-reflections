William Wilsom was called Will
He walked by side of a wagon wheel
When he found a well with water well
He drank as much as a weary whale
What welcomed warmth in him did swell
When a whispered word he heard one tell
"Wist ye not this water ain't well?"
From a withered old man with appearance frail
Will turned pale with a wretched chill
Then he waned and waddled back to the wheel
Where he walked and walked and walked until
He felt quick sick and then he fell
The wilting heat on him did rail
He knew death soon would him avail
But then a whale rolled down a hill
And squirted water which felt swell
Woke Will when water on him fell
With wonder at this giant whale
The whale then gaped and swalled Will
Will then made a stinky smell
Which the whale could not endure to dwell
So he spit out Will on a hill by a quail
Who said that he could call her Belle
