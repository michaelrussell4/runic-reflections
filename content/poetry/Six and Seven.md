# Six and Seven

> In the beginning 'twas empty and dark<br>
The Lord came forth to creation embark<br>
Six full days of work and test<br>
A seventh then to cease and rest<br>
Man God raised in glorious light<br>
Who by a tree fell into the dark night<br>
Then God descended to the fallen race<br>
Who by a tree raised and suffered disgrace<br>
Through six wounds pinned fast and sure<br>
A seventh then out from water did pour<br>
The Lord lay in tomb empty and dark<br>
'till he rose again to new life embark
