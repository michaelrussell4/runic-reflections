<p>Oh how I <strong>pine</strong> for Wisdom<br>
Before riches I put her<br>
As the wisest of men<br>
<br>I would make single mine eye<br>
like the <strong>Terrible</strong> one<br>
For a drink of her cup to buy<br>
<br>Forsaken, he paid as the <strong>Great</strong>est<br>
Hung on tree with pierced side<br>
Three square days staring in the abyss<br>
<br>Surely, he <strong>pined</strong> for Wisdom<br>
He drank of her cup<br>
From her runes his magik did burgeon<br></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This poem speaks of Odin, the terrible one, who sought wisdom at the price of his eye and even the cost of a great sacrifice in which he hung on a tree and pierced his side. Then he was permitted to stare into the abyss and learn of the mysteries of the source of the living universe (Yggdrasil) via the runes written on its roots by the Norns. And he was permitted to drink of Mimir's horn, the water of his well.</p>
<p>Of course, these images call to mind symbols (King Solomon, the wisest of men), or the archetype himself, Christ, who knew wisdom (Proverbs 8) and made his eye single (though in a figurative and not a literal sense, as with Odin), and hung on the tree (cross) and was pierced in his side, a worthy sacrifice. He drunk of the bitter dregs of the cup, though a different(?) cup in His case.</p>
<p>Another tidbit; as with another poem in this group of exercises, this poem exhibits the dual meaning of "pine", conveying yearning in the first usage and weariness or suffering in the second.</p>
