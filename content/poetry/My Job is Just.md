> Job was just, his complaint valid<br>
God on trial for glory pallid<br>
He claimed he'd been wronged<br>
Abject suffering prolonged<br>
Absconding friends and scoffing foes<br>
Job's mettle destroyed and his hope froze<br>
Where was the God of fathers before<br>
Who promised to answer the knock of door?<br>
Did Job not knock and ask to receive?<br>
A sound mind says he'd been deceived<br>
Promises given were tested to fail<br>
And Job was left to mourn and wail<br>
How is this just or fair or good?<br>
God and we look on who misunderstood?
