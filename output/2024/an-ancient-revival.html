<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This poem is a rehearsal of the funerary procession described in Egyptian occultism beginning with Ma'at weighing one's heart against her feather for judgement. Ammit awaits to devour the hearts of those who fail this test. Those who pass it succeed through the perilous journey of Duat and finally progress through a series of gates before reaching the Egptian equivalent of heaven, Aaru.</p>
<p>Such processions are described in the Book of Breathings and in certain papyri which depict the scene. The title of the poem refers to the breathings, or re-breathing; e.g., resurrection, or breathing again after one has stopped breathing. I.e., this is about the resurrection, or revival, theme prevalent in Egyptian writings.</p>

<th>Meaning &amp; Commentary</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Her scales doth weigh my heart</td>
<td>Referring to the scales of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat">Ma'at</a> which weigh the heart against her feather for judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My soul this place doth weather</td>
<td>There's a duality of meaning here due to contrasting meanings of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weather">weather</a>: 1. To withstand and come through 2. To wear down and fail. This leads to contrasting interpretations, the first being that this person made it through and the other being that he was worn down in defeat. This leaves it open to imagination whether this man is passing or failing at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>For what pains will I smart?</td>
<td>One definition of the verb <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smart">smart</a> is to pay as penalty. This line refers to such a recompence and the "pains" refer to burdens and deeds accumulated through life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My burden against this feather?</td>
<td>His burdens of life are represented by the weight of his heart, which here is weighed against the feather of Ma'at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Admit what watches—twelve above</td>
<td>This is the first word-play reference to an Egyptian deity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammit">Ammit</a> is the Egyptian goddess who stands by the scales of Ma'at and devours the hearts which are heavier than Ma'at's feather. It's a bit of a stretch, but "Admit" in this line refers to the goddess Ammit. In depictions of the sequences of rites the dead go through, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_funerary_practices#/media/File:The_judgement_of_the_dead_in_the_presence_of_Osiris.jpg">certain papyri</a> show 12 witnesses during the judgement scene. This is what is referred with the "twelve above". The line the renders to the effect of "Ammit watches the weighing of the heart along with the twelve witnesses"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Her eager eyes stay fast</td>
<td>This speaks of Ammit's eager eyes, ready to devour the heart if it fails the test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hungering for my mark of love</td>
<td>Ammit hungers for the heart, which in our culture is a symbol or mark of love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will this test I pass?</td>
<td>He wonders if he will pass this judgement test of the measures of Ma'at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Onward float I to do what?</td>
<td>This is the second play on words. "do what" refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duat">Duat</a> the underworld through which one must travel after passing Ma'at's measures. This is a perilous journey which entails sailing over treacherous waters, thus the usage of "onward float".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A very wearisome plight</td>
<td>A difficult journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ample time my thoughts to bat</td>
<td>During this solitary journey, there's time to think and reflect—the verb <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bat">bat</a> has a definition of "to discuss at length: consider in detail" and "to wander aimlessly", both being applicable here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Salvation makes this rite</td>
<td>The prospect of salvation (arrival in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaru">Aaru</a>) justifies the means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Woe" sigh rustic relics</td>
<td>The third play on words. "Woe sigh rus-" refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris">Osiris</a>. The line simultaneously describes the dead <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relic">relics</a> (corpses) in Duat that cry from their graves woes upon travelers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hands raw for they hath oar</td>
<td>The fourth and fifth play on words. "raw" simply refers to the sun-god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">Ra</a> and "hath oar" refers to the sky-goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor">Hathor</a>, wife of Ra. It simultaneously describes hands that are raw from oaring the boat over the water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This drama many tell it</td>
<td>This line simply mentions how this drama of this funerary procession is famous in Egyptian occultism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I finally reach the shore</td>
<td>He finally reaches the end of Duat and progresses to the next stage of the procession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dawning morning light</td>
<td>The sun-god Ra is also known as the "dawning morning", insinuating that this man approaches the final destination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And portals line my way</td>
<td>The final test of those who come this far is to pass through a series of gates, or portals which lead to Aaru, the field of reeds, or the Egyptian version of heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Releasing me from night</td>
<td>Progression out and away from Duat, which is a like a dark night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yonder reeds doth sway</td>
<td>Referring to the reeds of the fields in Aaru.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Twelve gates are here before me</td>
<td>He progresses through the 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_deities_of_the_underworld">gates</a> leading to Aaru.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And passing each new test</td>
<td>Passing the tests mentioned (gates).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My keys the sentinels see</td>
<td>He gives the keys to the twelve gate sentinels or gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>At last my fate is rest</td>
<td>He has achieved the blissful and heavenly destination—final rest.</td>
</tr>

<h3>Alternate interpretation</h3>
<p>Wholly apart from the Egyptian interpretation lies a very subtle and only partially complete interpretation of a crucible of temptation with a certain temptress. The man is first tempted by a serpentine mistress that tests his heart and weathers his soul. He speaks of potential pains as he weighs out his options and desires as heavenly eyes witness him from above. The temptress is eager to win him over hungering for his love. He contemplates if he can pass this test. He battles, journeys through inner struggles, and repeats a trope common in lore. He finally comes out on top after a battle in the darkness.</p>
