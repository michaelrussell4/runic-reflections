# A Maternal Touch

> Solace and beauty wouldn't be had<br>
Nor the safety and calm of heart<br>
If it weren't for maternity's presence<br>
Were her gentle soft touch to depart<br>
She's a refuge from sorrow<br>
A balm for our pain<br>
She's a flower in a field<br>
A trust, a love no one could feign
