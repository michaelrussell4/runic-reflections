## Commentary

A little poem entitled with reference to Pip from Great Expectations and playing with his name by referencing `pip`, a python programming tool for installing packages. Pip, from Dicken's Great Expectations, pursues the unattainable Estella, a girl reared to punish man by luring him in and offering only an empty heart. Pip tries and fails.
