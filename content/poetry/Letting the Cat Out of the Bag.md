I'll break the ice by telling a story: Some lady was feeling under the weather. She'd been burning the midnight oil at work, and her job was no piece of cake, either. But she couldn't just throw in the towel. This job was no dime a dozen; it was her chance to make it big! Besides, she wasn't eager to throw caution to the wind and test her chances at unemployment. No pain, no gain, right?

But—to cut to the chase—out of the blue, she woke up sick. She thought she'd tough it out and let sleeping dogs lie. She raced to work, fingers crossed that things wouldn't go down in flames. She got to work and hit the ground running—setting up appointments, checking emails—and then!—a message from her boss: "Meet me in my office ASAP." Maybe this was about that raise she'd put in for—what a silver lining, she thought. Every dog has its day.

"Megan, I need to talk to you about your job," her boss started. Megan replied, "Yes, sir. Thank you." He continued, "Our competitors stole our thunder last quarter. We didn't get the bid—we've been cut short. Sure, you've been on the ball. You went the whole nine yards in your report to me last week. But we're in hot water. Without that job, we're skating on thin ice. To make a long story short, we have to let some people go..."

She nodded as he finished the routine speech. No use burning bridges—she'd pack up and head home. It was raining cats and dogs outside as she trudged home. But as she walked, she saw a bag with something moving inside—it turned out to be a kitten. She picked it up and looked around. Just then, the kitten spoke: "Could you help me out, miss?" The lady was blown away—a talking cat! She stammered back, "Sure, I can help." "Well, why don't you put your money where your mouth is? I need a few bucks, is all," said the feline. The lady was taken aback, but she fumbled through her pockets and gave the kitten a bit of cash. The kitten put the bills in its mouth and dashed away.

The lady stared until the cat was out of sight, and after picking her jaw up off the ground, she continued her walk home. When she got home, she plopped on her bed and was out like a light. While she slept, she had a dream where the cat who'd bummed cash off her appeared. He said, "Look, I don't know what's going on here—your guess is as good as mine. But you got me out of a pickle, so I guess I owe you. Check your pockets when you wake up."

Megan woke up. It felt like it had been moments, but really it was the next day. She felt much better. She remembered the dream, checked her pockets, and to her amazement, pulled out a check for one million big ones. She took it to the bank and, sure enough, it cashed.
