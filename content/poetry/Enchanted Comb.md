> My hair got messy from wind that had blown<br>
> So I hid myself in my home all alone<br>
> When in my room, I began to roam<br>
> I found myself a little blue comb<br>
> Which I used on my hair with styling foam<br>
> I daydreamed then—a habit to which I'm prone<br>
> I was in a garden and looked like a gnome<br>
> And my name was Otto—a palindrome<br>
> I lived in a giant greenhouse dome<br>
> Surrounded by plants, my new biome<br>
> I spoke that language where "hi" is "shalom"<br>
> I had lunch with the great old saint, Jerome<br>
> Who was writing lots of words in a tome<br>
> I asked him if he wanted some honeycomb<br>
> He said it tastes better than styrofoam<br>
> I agreed and awoke back in my home
