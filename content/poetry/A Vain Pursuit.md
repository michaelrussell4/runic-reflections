An old man said to a boy: "Can you help me find my treasure? If you do I'll pay you with a portion of it." The boy thought of the gold and wealth and, being quite poor, gladly consented and asked where to look. The old man told him to start digging. When the boy asked where the man answered: "Right here is a good place to start." The boy obtained a shovel and began digging.

By the end of the day the boy had dug a large hole deeper than his height. The old man looked inside and said, "You've found it!" The boy was confused as he stared at the empty hole. "Sir, what did I find? There's nothing in the hole." The old man replied, "Yes, that's right. Would you like me to pay you your portion now?" The boy was even more confused and replied, "Sir, how can you pay me when nothing has been found?" "I'll give you half of it, how about that?" the old man said.

The boy's confusion now turned to anger, "You mean I've spent the whole day digging for nothing? And now I shall receive my reward of nothing? I've been foolish to help you." The old man reassured the boy:

Your work has not been in vain. You see, I spent my whole life searching for the most valuable treasures. In my small village our wealthiest man possessed a black stone of exquisite sharpness from which he made spearheads and knives. This prized, black stone was called obsidian and was the most precious stone I knew of. I searched and searched until I found some for myself and then I became the most wealthy man of my village.

But soon I met a wealthy traveler who passed through our village. He had a robe made of the smoothest and finest fabric I had ever seen. He told me it was silk and was made with great skill and effort and was the most expensive fabric in all the world. I then left my village and sought to find where I could obtain this silk.

I traveled until I found someone who knew the trade of making silk. To my great astonishment, I learned that this expensive fabric was produced from a certain moth. You see, moths are like butterflies and begin as a small worm-like creature that eats from leaves until it is ready to build a cocoon. It wraps itself in this cocoon and hangs from a leaf until it becomes a moth. But a certain kind of these makes a cocoon of silk thread. I learned how one could take the cocoon before the moths breaks out of it and boil it in water, killing the moth and softening the silk. Then, slowly and carefully, the silk thread could be unwound and then used to weave into fabric. I learned this trade and made and sold silk and became quite wealthy.

But I soon learned of something more valuable than silkâ€”pearls. You see, pearls are made by shelled creatures that live deep underwater. Courageous divers swim deep to the floor of the ocean and bring up these shelled creatures and pry open their shells with knives. Most of the shelled creatures don't have pearls in them. Divers may open thousands of them before finding the one who has a pearl inside. I began learning this trade and began diving in search for the pearl. I dove and searched all day every day. I became a strong swimming and could hold my breath for a long time. My luck turned up soon because while many divers wouldn't find a single pearl their whole life, I found one after only three years of diving. I was then a very wealthy man indeed.

But my wealth led me to a society of others who were also very wealthy. I learned of many other treasures such as diamonds, rubies, silver, and gold. I traded and worked until I gained all these treasures. I spent many years after that chasing wealth and though I accumulated many treasures and became very wealthy, I was not content.

Once when I was telling my sorrows to a friend he told me that there was a being who lived at the top of the highest mountain nearby my home who was thought to have answers to every question. I thought he would certainly know the answer to my question so I journeyed up the mountain to ask him. When I arrived I found no such man, only a bird perched on a tree. I was greatly disappointed at this and shouted: 'Who can tell me what is more valuable than all my treasures?'

Then, to my great surprise, the bird replied, 'All my treasures' I marveled at this. I responded to the bird's question, 'What treasures do you have?' Instead of answering my question the bird asked me, 'What treasures do you have?' I then showed the bird all my treasures of gold, silver, rubies, and diamonds and said, 'Here are all of my treasures.' The bird responded, 'All my treasures.' 'No, these are mine,' I responded. 'No, these are mine,' he insisted.

At first I was angry that this bird claimed that my treasures were his. But then I began to see the great wisdom in his words and I forsook my wealth. I buried it there at the top of the mountain and learned a great secret, 'Nothing is greater than all the treasures of the world.' I climbed that mountain burdened by the weight of my wealth, both in body and mind. I left that mountain feeling light and free in body and mind. Nothing truly was greater than all my wealth. And now I give you this gift.

The boy thought about what the man had said and asked, "Sir, this mountain where you buried your wealth, where is it?" The man replied, "Why, it's this mountain here" and he pointed to a tall mountain within sight. And the boy was enlightened and replied, "Thank you, sir." And he set off for that mountain leaving the old man in deep thought.

## Commentary

This story uses irony as an attempt to criticize common notions of enlightenment which are often trivial and impractical. While there may be truth in the lesson learned by the old man, the boy practically seeks to obtain the wasted treasure of the man. Who was enlightened?
