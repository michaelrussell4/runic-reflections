> In the midst of eternity<br>
There lies a man, a sacred tree<br>
From him there grows the fruit of light<br>
Which if partaken lends new life<br>
When man fell this tree was taken<br>
Piercing heart and love forsaken<br>
In its place a sapling rose<br>
Who man did smite with deadly blows<br>
From it oozed sweet myrrh and wine<br>
Mouth to partake and head enshrine<br>
The tree was split and hell redeemed<br>
For those who in a slumber dreamed<br>
From the grave rose beauty and blind<br>
New life begun from the first kind

## Notes

👁️🌲🍹🍞

Vague references to God, the tree of life, and Christ, the new tree from which the blood-red wine and annoiting oil came. Yggdrasil split and Hel was opened. Balder and Hod came forth (beauty and blind). A mixture of Norse and esoteric-Christian motifs combined.
