> Spring into being blossoming buds<br>
> A green scene of life without strife<br>
> What was sown is now grown<br>
> To the oxygen gas leaves cleave fast<br>
> The garden bombarded bleating in heat<br>
> Burned by the power of what it must devour<br>
> Withering and dithering but pressing on<br>
> A splash of relief occasionally lulls grief<br>
> Cool wind bends their stalwart stalks<br>
> A harvest steals and spreads their seeds<br>
> Smell of cider, spice, and frost<br>
> Strength wanes old but it runs deep<br>
> The warblers have departed a new path charted<br>
> An old man lays down in his white gown
