## Meaning & Commentary

This poem is quite abstract and its meaning may be difficult to infer without commentary. Also, the poem is, as the name states, quite bleak.

The fetus is life—human and animal—which exists in an environment that is seemingly hostile, or indifferent. The environment seems to only favor life and proliferation. It doesn't care about quality of life or experience. This environment is likened to a mother, though not a good one. In this environment, pondering and seeking for truth is futile or difficult because the environment doesn't reward that pursuit, it cares only for production of life.

Thinking can even "\[lead\] to death if progress halts." The mantra "Forget, obey, expunge all fault" describes the prioritization of ignorant survival over learning intelligence. As the final lines suggest, this environment (mother) only cares that life will last, not that it improves or grows in intelligence. It's a self-sustaining (circuitous) environment that is optimized for that one purpose.
