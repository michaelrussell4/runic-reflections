> A pair of fish, Jim caught him two<br>
> "Well with these fish know what I'll do?"<br>
> "Stick 'em in a pot and make a stew"<br>
> But for two stones old Jim mistook them<br>
> Took them home and then he cooked them<br>
> Biting down his teeth fell out<br>
> Thatâ€™s when he discovered rocks ain't trout
