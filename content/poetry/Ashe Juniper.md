> Coniferous canopy born from clay<br>
> In limestone soil I see you play<br>
> Green all year whether wet or dry<br>
> Ah-choo! Bless me, I've tears in my eye<br>
><br>
> When the cold comes in your men burst out<br>
> A swarm, a cloud; they fly about<br>
> Looking for love; "sniffle" I'm sick<br>
> To a lovely lady lucky ones will stick<br>
><br>
> Then the women are adorned in beads of blue<br>
> An offering for the angels to chew<br>
> And when they need to go poo poo<br>
> A new one's born. I'm sorry. Eww.
