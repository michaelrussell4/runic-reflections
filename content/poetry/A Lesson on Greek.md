> Mr. Greek he likes to sneak<br>
> Into our English; take a peek<br>
> Examine examples I give here now<br>
> And you will hear a Hellene sound<br>
> <br>
> The study of life is **bio**logy<br>
> A story of a life is **bio**graphy<br>
> Things you can eat are edible<br>
> They also are **bio**degradable<br>
> What do you think that **bio** means?<br>
> "Life" is right, you are so keen<br>
> <br>
> A **chron**ic thing happens for a long time<br>
> A **chron**ology orders things by time<br>
> To syn**chron**ize aligns by time<br>
> Also, time happens to rhyme with time<br>
> "Chronos" means "time", if you couldn't tell<br>
> <br>
> **Geo**graphy studies land and earth<br>
> **Geo**logy sticks to rocks and dirt<br>
> I wonder why the differences arise<br>
> **Geo**thermal heat makes geysers rise<br>
> Guess what "geo" means, will you?<br>
> "Earth" is right you know it's true<br>
> <br>
> **Hydro** **pyro**, what a pair!<br>
> Opposites that are not rare<br>
> One is hot the other wet<br>
> One is blue the other red<br>
> **Pyro**: fire, water: **hydro**<br>
> Yes, you got it, now you know<br>
> <br>
> **Philosophy** is love of wisdom<br>
> Discovering all things hidden<br>
> While **philology** is love of words<br>
> This lesson's not just for the birds<br>
> What is **philia**, **sophia**, **logos**?<br>
> "Love", "wisdom", "word", what prose<br>
> <br>
> Now we're done<br>
> I hope it was fun
