> The grazing cows who chomp on hay<br>
> These ones are known as bovine<br>
> The lazy cats who sleep all day<br>
> We call these fellers feline<br>
> <br>
> The big bad wolf who sniffs for food<br>
> His type is known as lupine<br>
> While fatted pigs with manners rude<br>
> We call these ones the porcine<br>
> <br>
> Howling dogs will bark and play<br>
> They have a name: it's canine<br>
> Horses gallop every day<br>
> We call this group equine<br>
> <br>
> Brutish bears feared everywhere<br>
> Are known to be ursine<br>
> Soft sheeps bleat but do not scare<br>
> We name these ones the ovine<br>
> <br>
> The playful kid grows up a goat<br>
> His name would be caprine<br>
> Dolphins swim faster than boats<br>
> We call such swimmers delphine<br>
> <br>
> The clever fox he's cute but keen<br>
> We name this thing vulpine<br>
> The antlered friends in forest green<br>
> We label them cervine
