# To wait the wait

>If you plant some plants in pots<br>
And watch your watch while waiting<br>
You'll tie your hair in knots<br>
It's terribly frustrating<br>
<br>
Instead just dance a dance<br>
Or fish for fish for fun<br>
A game of cards perchance<br>
Or on a slide slide your bum<br>
<br>
Watch rain drops drop<br>
Or drive on a drive<br>
At a shop you could shop<br>
Just live your lives<br>
<br>
I to my point point clearly<br>
Which is that plants grow slowly<br>
When you face vases nearly<br>
You'll fathom boredom wholly
