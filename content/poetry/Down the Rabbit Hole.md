# Down the Rabbit Hole

> Lovely little Alice ran to catch a rabbit<br>
But down a **hole** he disappearedâ€”a leporine habbit<br>
Quickly Alice followed him and sqeezed herself inside<br>
Shocked at what she saw she simply stared wide-eyed<br>
Stranger things she'd never seen than in this quaint **burrow**<br>
She gazed upon a **sea urchin** which made her eyebrows furrow<br>
"Whatever would an urchin be doing in the ground?"<br>
This she said when then she heard a solemn speaking sound<br>
She looked to see **an old, wise man** with sandals on his feet<br>
He smiling said, "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet"<br>
Upon these words she pondered, just for a moment or two<br>
But then felt her feet get wet, "There's **water** on my shoes!"<br>
A **Wiccan** witch appeared nearby who cackled at the sight<br>
"My dear", she said, with evil tone, "Let me have a bite"<br>
Alice feared and ran away far from that wretched dame<br>
She bumped into a girl named **Yin** and then her brother **Yang**<br>
Yin softly asked, "Oh are you lost?" And Yang was very mad<br>
"Why yes I'm very lost indeed. Oh goodness this is bad"<br>
"Don't be afraid. I'm here to help you calm **anxiety** away"<br>
"Where do you want to go, please tell me this I pray"<br>
Alice answered with a tear, "At home I wish to be"<br>
Yin replied, "Well have no fear, from here that's quite easy"<br>
"You're **homesick** now but turn around and tell me what you see"<br>
Alice turned and saw her **house** and ran there thankfully
