> Coniferous canopy born from clay
> In limestone soil I see you play
> Green all year whether wet or dry
> Ah-choo! Bless me, I've tears in my eye
>
> When the cold comes in your men burst out
> A swarm, a cloud; they fly about
> Looking for love; "sniffle" I'm sick
> To a lovely lady lucky ones will stick
>
> Then the women are adorned in beads of blue
> An offering for the angels to chew
> And when they need to go poo poo
> A new one's born. I'm sorry. Eww.
