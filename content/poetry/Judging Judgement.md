I recently heard an account of someone who was accused of being judgy for maintaining basic religious views, at least from the description I was given. This led me to think about the idea of being judgemental. "Judge not that ye be not judged" (Matthew 7:1)—I get this: don't be a hypocrite or nitpick others’ lives.

We've all got problems and getting unsolicited, petty advice is annoying, even if it's accurate. This kind of behavior often triggers responses like: "You don't know me", "Who are you to judge", or other defensive posturing. Ideally, we'd all be humble enough to accept even these minor criticisms, but as a society, we've adopted a reasonable distaste towards this, except maybe in cases of those close relationships where it might be appropriate.

The problem is, we don't know the complete context of the lives of those we might judge. Holding them to unreasonable standards that we can't even maintain ourselves is unfair. But here's the important line: this is a totally separate matter from judging actions and moral injustice.

There's an ample supply of scriptures where instruction is given to rebuke and reprove those who are astray. I think it's helpful to read these in a discussion like this:

Luke 17:3

> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

Matthew 18:15

> Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

2 Timothy 4:2

> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

Doctrine & Covenants 121:43

> Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;

We also can't forget Nephi, who sharply rebuked his rebellious brothers for their lack of faith and obedience to their father or God's commandments. His rebukes sometimes landed, leading to his brothers' humbling themselves and repenting. But other times it ended in their attempts on his life.

Nephi let his brothers know the truth. Importantly, he was speaking from a sincere desire for their welfare (2 Nephi 1:25). He wasn't gloating in his spiritual success nor rejoicing in their failure. This is a crucial distinction between moral discernment and the kind of judgement we are to avoid.

Moral discernment, or faithful adherence to commandments, may include the following:

- Identifying and condemning sin
- Removing yourself from an event/group
- Criticizing a moral injustice
- Privately criticizing with sincere hope in the individual
- Encouraging repentance with loved ones

While hypocritical or misappropriated judgement includes:

- Harsh penalization based on partial information
- Public shaming
- Gossiping behind backs
- Nitpicking minor faults
- Gloating about your superiority
- Sarcastically or comically describing others faults

These are by no means exhaustive lists, but they help build a clearer picture.

In a world where moral standards have and continue to plummet, it shouldn't be surprising that moral discernment is mistaken to be a crime, an ironic attempt to make the meek look haughty and the righteous wicked. This is because, as Nephi said, "the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center." (1 Nephi 16:2)

Let this not deter us from sincerely seeking to personally pursue righteousness and virtue and help those in our circles do the same. Of course, not everyone in our society shares the moral baseline or religion we do. But we can meet them where they're at. When we have a sincere heart and a humble attitude, truth delivered will not be condemned by God.
