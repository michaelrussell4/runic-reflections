# Red-faced Tom

> Feckless Tom<br>
Had a fecund wife<br>
Having two large drupes<br>
And a kitchen knife<br>
<br>
Tom could hardly wait<br>
For his meal at hand<br>
For to masticate<br>
He did then demand<br>
<br>
But his niggardly ways<br>
Left his wife quite cross<br>
Gave a niggling gaze<br>
His face a slap across
