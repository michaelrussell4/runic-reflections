> My reflection in darkness beckons my entrance<br>
> With shimmering pieces of mystery there<br>
> Far and unknown myself I am<br>
> My relationships tie to veiled places<br>
> Are they hidden or are they forgotten?<br>
> Is knowledge lost or intentionally hid?<br>
> Alas, all is vanity, vanity, vanity, I pity.
