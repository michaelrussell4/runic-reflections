> How do you get there, Michael?<br>
Do you drive a motercyle?<br>
Or rather a pedal-powered cycle?<br>
Can you race and beat your rival?<br>
Have you armed yourself with rifle?<br>
You do what you do for survival<br>
Don't you forget to recycle<br>
Better yet to read the Bible<br>
Before you make your arrival<br>
That's how you'll get there, Michael
