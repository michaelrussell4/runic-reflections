> Except when given twice<br><br>
> To alter your words at the altar<br>
> Is not so very nice<br><br>
> Lay bare in mind gummy bears are yummy<br>
> But artificial dyes aren't good for your tummy<br><br>
> Ensure you insure your stuff<br>
> For when the going's rough<br><br>
> Site your sources, they're a pretty sight<br>
> In this some will delight<br><br>
> Two that duel are a fighting dual<br>
> He whose skills are best is who's cool
