> Life is a test or a tragedy<br>
> I can't tell which<br>
> Set up by His majesty<br>
> Or an accidental glitch<br>
> <br>
> Our struggles and suffering<br>
> Matter or they don't<br>
> Simulation buffering<br>
> This wrestle is my wont<br>
> <br>
> A mind exists somewhere<br>
> A start had to occur<br>
> I can't see it anywhere<br>
> My cursed eyes see blur<br>
> <br>
> Ignorance is my prison<br>
> Amnesia are its bars<br>
> I've fallen and I've risen<br>
> Beneath the sight of stars
