> Cold and hard these stones of gray<br>
> Death beneath but does life stay?<br>
> A hope of hope yearns for this<br>
> That oblivion does not persist<br>

> Stones, cry out and speak to me<br>
> Please confirm if ye still be<br>
> Your trodden path I surely follow<br>
> Share with me what you all know
