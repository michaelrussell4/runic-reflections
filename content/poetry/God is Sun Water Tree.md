Thou art the sun with light sublime
Upon creation doth thou shine
A seminal orb of glorious light
Warmeth our souls, overcometh night

Thou art the water clear and blue
The stream of life and morning dew
A vital substance hast thou brought
Quenching thirst, cleansing spot

Thou art the tree of life divine
In hell thy roots, in heaven thy vine
A powerful rod of priestly rite
Nourishing fruit, beautiful sight

## Notes

There are many symbols for God. Various cultures have pantheons including references to the powerful and crucial objects of the sun, water, and the tree. I especially like how water and the light of the sun are the lifesource of the tree, all of which are symbols of God. These symbols are deeply ingrained into humanity. Perhaps they're woven into our DNA.
