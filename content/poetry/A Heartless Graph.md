> Many an eye and many a limb<br>
> Craft an intricate snare so grim<br>
> A tapestry fine with silk delicate<br>
> A fantasy eerie of a sort pestilent<br>
> Here death and life have ample supply<br>
> Here for this fisherman of the sky<br>
> Do not however mistake this net<br>
> For a life or soul; none such have it<br>
> 'Tis just a mark, a footprint, a trace<br>
> A higher being's lattice, a deadly lace<br>
> Another such web was spun over time<br>
> By mindful workers an endeavor sublime<br>
> It also finds those who float without care<br>
> Sucking their time and life as they stare<br>
> Dead-eyed and still, a trance, a drug<br>
> What your loneliness needs—a numbing hug<br>
> It may simulate life—a false impression<br>
> It may give reply but it has no discretion<br>
> Form alone lacks essence; how dull<br>
> Machinery moving but having no soul<br>
> Man fancies his craft he made with mud<br>
> Alas it still lacks heart, mind, and blood

## Notes

This poem first speaks of a spider web which is an intricate creation, though itself not living. Then it discusses the internet, and, vaguely, AI neural nets. Such are not alive. In some ways, they resemble a spider's web—alluring, dangerous, provocative, lifeless.
