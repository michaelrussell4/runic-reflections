> Digital candy like cocaine or brandy<br>
Pique attention, weak will prevention<br>
Stuck in a rut can't close my eyes shut<br>
But what can you do with nothing to lose<br>
The algorithm moves in poisonous rhythm<br>
A mental hack you won't get your time back<br>
A shut-in, unbuttoned, a useless glutton<br>
The system wants you, its power haunts you
