> Slithering forward _incessantly_ and steadily, _sanguine_ eyes fixate, locked on unsuspecting prey. <br>A _caliginous_ veil of the night _expediently_ hinders sight. <br>A _flagrant_ tongue—a dark _divination—rends_ the air with _foretastes_ of _satiety_.<br>
> Elsewhere, a _fatigued_ alertness longs for rest. <br>Nocturnal _ambience_ offers a soothing but _illusory_ hush.<br>
> _Ebullition_, an _ephemeral_ twitch of pain, equally _smart_ passion _piques_ as warm juices drain. <br>For predator and prey relief now ensues. But does it sin undo?<br>
> _Numinous_ eyes of the night sky _callously_ observe with _abstention_. <br>They twinkle and stare but offer no _retribution_.<br> _Disillusioned_, I bow in despair.<br>
> Just then a _serpentine_ light strikes fast in the _periphery—a_ wink, a wave, or perhaps a tear?

## Meaning & Commentary

### Overview

This poem describes an encounter where a snake strikes and eats its prey. A first-person observer wrestles with the encounter as a perceived injustice and awaits a divine intervention. Upon finding none, the observer despairs but is then inspired by a mysterious celestial interaction—a shooting star, symbolizing an act of God, though the act is vague enough to leave the observer wondering what God's judgement is on the matter.

### Specific term descriptions

- **Sanguine**: This word is somewhat of a [contronym](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contranym) reflecting both eager optimism and bloodlust, two sentimentally opposing meanings. This aptly describes the snake in this case: hopeful for a meal and thirsting for blood.
- **Caliginous veil**: This descriptor describes the dark night which makes it difficult to see. I bring in a religious reference by using the term "veil", a term that describes the thing that separates us from God. And I use **rends** when describing the snake's flehmen tongue movement. This references Ether 4:15, "...ye shall rend that veil of unbelief ..." which speaks of rending the veil of unbelief, thus insinuating the snake's knowledge of hidden mysteries—things beyond the veil, things of God. Adding to this thought comes the word **divination** which further supports this idea that the snake can reach through the veil and ascertain hidden things—literally the snake can also ascertain sensory information about its prey beyond what is visible.
- **flagrant**: This word's modern meaning of "conspicuously offensive" as well as its original, now archaic, meaning of "fiery hot" are both applicable in this description of the snake's tongue. Certainly, a snake's tongue, and bite, could be termed fiery and offensive (fiery flying serpents).
- **Serpentine shape strikes**: God's act, the shooting star, uses language reminiscent of a snake which strikes, poetically inferring some similarity between the perceived enemy, the snake, and divinity; snakes are sometimes understood as divine symbols in ancient cultures.
- **Ebullition**: This describes the violent outburst of the snake's attack which results in "warm juices \[draining\]" (blood).
- **Numinous**: The stars are the numinous, or divine and heavenly watchers. They watch this dreadful act but don't react (**abstention**), giving the impression that they don't find the act morally apprehensible.
