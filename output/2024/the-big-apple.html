<p>Lord Archibald Yorkshire III<br>
Was wondering yonder <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thither">thither</a><br>
When a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bellowing">bellowing</a> noise was heard<br>
A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fissure">fissure</a> which caused a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dither">dither</a><br><br>
Down he dropped <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/awry">awry</a> with cry<br>
Where to he could not tell<br>
When with a sigh he did not die<br>
In modern Brooklyn he fell<br><br>
"What is this place, what is this smell?"<br>
He asked in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sordid">sordid</a> mess<br>
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Assenting">Assenting</a> that he here <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/befell">befell</a><br>
As gazing to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assess">assess</a><br><br>
Standing up and brushing off<br>
He harked one <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quaintly">quaintly</a> dressed<br>
Who <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/staggered">staggered</a> with a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quaff">quaff</a> and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cough">cough</a><br>
"The <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fuzz">fuzz</a>? I didn't theft"<br><br>
Then straightly turned himself around<br>
And <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lurched">lurched</a> his march <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astray">astray</a><br>
"A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/queerer">queerer</a> man I have not found"<br>
As the lord's calm did <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allay">allay</a><br><br>
That is to say it went away<br>
And left him sorely <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vexed">vexed</a><br>
When to his shock he heard a, "Hey"<br>
And here's what happened next<br><br>
"Hey you get off my spot!"<br>
Said a man apparently mad<br>
The lord was with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gentility">gentility</a> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fraught">fraught</a><br>
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Forthwith">Forthwith</a> the place he <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bade">bade</a><br><br>
Then rudely came the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bogarting">bogarting</a> man<br>
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Chuntering">Chuntering</a> curses <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rifely">rifely</a><br>
The lord appalled held up his hands<br>
The scene soon turned quite lively<br><br>
"Sir, I say", the lord objected<br>
"Thou art a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niggard">niggard</a> indeed"<br>
"A what?" the man in shock <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ejected">ejected</a><br>
And <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ensued">ensued</a> to roll up his sleeve<br><br>
Shortly there came a pop and a pow<br>
The lord was taken back<br>
But returned and matched him blow for blow<br>
They succeeded each other to whack<br><br>
When lights did flash and whistles blow<br>
The dirty man dashed away<br>
The lord looked upon the lights <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aglow">aglow</a><br>
As on him strong hands lay<br><br>
"What's the meaning of all of this?"<br>
The lord in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dismay">dismay</a> there <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/averred">averred</a><br>
"Give me your name" urged officer Chris<br>
"I'm Lord Archibald Yorkshire III"<br><br>
"We've got another nut", Chris muttered<br>
To a radio pulled from his waist<br>
The lord confusedly stammered and sputtered<br>
Which did not help his case<br><br>
In <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/remonstration">remonstration</a> he began to run<br>
To flee from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquitous">ubiquitous</a> harm<br>
When Zeus's lightning struck his bum<br>
And he <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/convulsed">convulsed</a> in great alarm<br><br>
A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phantasmagoria">phantasmagoria</a> interrupted his thought<br>
On a magic cart he flew<br>
But on no ordinary cart was he caught<br>
For came out of it strange new food<br><br>
On a sausage crossed yellow lines<br>
In long white bread it lay<br>
A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/piquant">piquant</a>, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pungent">pungent</a> combination <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/refined">refined</a><br>
"An <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exquisite">exquisite</a> taste" he did say<br><br>
Then floating o'er his familiar <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shire">shire</a><br>
A body lay under a tree<br>
By a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groveling">groveling</a> pig which an apple it admired<br>
"Who's that there, why it's me!"<br><br>
Then entered the lord to his body again<br>
And awoke to himself once more<br>
With mustard seed on his lip and chin<br>
"Away" the pig he implored<br><br>
To his side he saw a giant red apple<br>
Which he tossed at the fleeing pig<br>
He marveled in thought and let out a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cackle">cackle</a><br>
Then picked and threw a young <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sprig">sprig</a><br><br>
An aroma of bread through the air did waft<br>
"Lady Yorkshire's work", said he<br>
Pining for her embrace so soft<br>
Quite a contrast of his late company<br><br>
"Dreaming again", she said in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jest">jest</a><br>
As he at the house arrived<br>
"Oh it's good to be home my lovely <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blest">blest</a>"<br>
As he let out a relieving sigh<br></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This story dictates a real (or imagined) journey of an Englishman of Yorkshire who falls through a chasm and (loosely referencing an event from the movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113538/">A Kid in King Aurthur's Court</a>). Upon landing, he finds himself in a strange and foreign land (modern New York). After a couple encounters with individuals exhibiting an indecency typical of New Yorkers, he ends up running from a cop and gets tassed. At this point, he becomes unconscious and floats back to his homeland riding upon a hotdog stand as he partakes of the unfamiliar but much appreciated food.</p>
<p>References connect themes through a large apple, hinting at the nickname of New York, "The Big Apple" (hence the title of the poem), as well as the pig relating to a hotdog (made of pork), mustard seed relating to mustard sauce, and an aroma of bread relating to a hotdog bun. One might reasonably argue that the episode of Lord Archibald was imaginary, but there's enough left open-ended that an alternative interpretation could also be had—this is by design.</p>
